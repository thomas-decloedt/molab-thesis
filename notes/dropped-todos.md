# Dropped TODOs

* Error Analysis
    * Error categories, see table 3 \cite{lehmannLanguageModelsControlled2023}.
    * Look at swapped triples for example.
    * Look at some examples that have incorrect semantics (structure) in base and how they are correct in RAG.
* Analyse semantic correctness generated SPARQL assumming perfect linking.
* Investigate quality synthetic dataset with and without generated squall of base model.
