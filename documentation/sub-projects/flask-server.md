title: Flask Server
---
Code available upon request (see README).

A minimal Python Flask server was set up to facilitate interaction with the AWS server. The Flask server acts as a middleware, handling requests from the Python package and passing them on to the Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) pipeline. The Flask server is hosted on the same AWS instance as the KGQA pipeline.
