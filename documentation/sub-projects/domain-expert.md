title: Domain Expert
---
Code available upon request (see README).

The domain expert was both inspired by [G-Retriever](https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever), and the code base to train it was started from the forked project of it.

Adaptations were made such that the SQUALL expert was used as generator for the RAG architecture instead of an untrained LLM.

Other domains were experimented with, for example, dblp. A smaller domain was ultimately opted for, to keep the engineering challenge and investment in terms of time and computation more appropriate for a proof-of-concept.
