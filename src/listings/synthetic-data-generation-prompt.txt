Follow the requirement to only return SQUALL.

Here are some examples:

### Demonstration
Question: Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the iNaturalist 2018 benchmark dataset?
SQUALL: A <Dataset> is a <has_dataset> of a thing X and has a rdfs:label whose string matches "iNaturalist 2018" and X is a <has_benchmark> of a thing Y and a thing is a <has_evaluation> of X and if defined, what is a <has_model> of Y and has a rdfs:label?

// Etc.

### Task
Question: Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Depth DDPPO model and include the links to their code?
