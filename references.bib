  abstract = {Ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization. Ontology provides domain vocabulary, domain knowledge, common understanding, shareability, information interoperability, reusability, concept hierarchy, and relationships that support semantic information retrieval. Ontology improves performance of the system by addressing interoperability issues due to semantic and syntactic heterogeneity. Vast numbers of application domain experts are using ontologies in diverse applications. Use of effective and efficient ontology storage system results improved performance in applications and enables semantic information retrieval. Many prominent researchers and software agencies have proposed and developed several ontology storage methods and tools with various features. The choice of a specific storage model/tool always depend on the specific purpose of the application and the nature of features that are available in the storage model/tool to be utilized in the specific applications. The familiarity of various ontology storage models and tools with the respective features helps user to choose an appropriate storage structure aiming at high-performance applications. The current research work is a comprehensively authentic study carryout out on various ontology storage models and tools with their respective features, which are very essential for optimum performance.},

  abstract = {Software repositories have a plethora of information about software development, encompassing details such as code contributions, bug reports, code reviews, and project documentation. This rich source of data can be harnessed to enhance not only software quality and development velocity but also to gain insights into team collaboration, identify potential bottlenecks, and inform strategic decision-making throughout the software development lifecycle. Previous studies show that many stakeholders cannot benefit from the project information due to the technical knowledge and expertise required to extract the project data. To lower the barrier to entry by automating the process of extracting and analyzing repository data, we explored the potential of using a large language model (LLM) to develop a chatbot for answering questions related to software repositories. We evaluated the chatbot on a set of 150 software repository-related questions. We found that the chatbot correctly answered one question about the repository. This result prompted us to shift our focus to investigate the challenges in adopting LLMs for the out-of-the-box development of software repository chatbots. We identified five main challenges related to retrieving data, structuring the data, and generating the answer to the user's query. Among these challenges, the most frequent (83.3\%) is the inaccurate retrieval of data to answer questions. In this paper, we share our experience and challenges in developing an LLM-based chatbot to answer software repository-related questions within the SE community. We also provide recommendations on mitigating these challenges. Our findings will serve as a foundation to drive future research aimed at enhancing LLMs for adoption in extracting useful information from software repositories, fostering advancements in natural language understanding, data retrieval, and response generation within the context of software repository-related questions and analytics.},

  abstract = {In computer science, an abstract semantic graph (ASG) or term graph is a form of abstract syntax in which an expression of a formal or programming language is represented by a graph whose vertices are the expression's subterms. An ASG is at a higher level of abstraction than an abstract syntax tree (or AST), which is used to express the syntactic structure of an expression or program. ASGs are more complex and concise than ASTs because they may contain shared subterms (also known as "common subexpressions"). Abstract semantic graphs are often used as an intermediate representation by compilers to store the results of performing common subexpression elimination upon abstract syntax trees. ASTs are trees and are thus incapable of representing shared terms. ASGs are usually directed acyclic graphs (DAG), although in some applications graphs containing cycles may be permitted. For example, a graph containing a cycle might be used to represent the recursive expressions that are commonly used in functional programming languages as non-looping iteration constructs. The mutability of these types of graphs, is studied in the field of graph rewriting. The nomenclature term graph is associated with the field of term graph rewriting, which involves the transformation and processing of expressions by the specification of rewriting rules, whereas abstract semantic graph is used when discussing linguistics, programming languages, type systems and compilation. Abstract syntax trees are not capable of sharing subexpression nodes because it is not possible for a node in a proper tree to have more than one parent. Although this conceptual simplicity is appealing, it may come at the cost of redundant representation and, in turn, possibly inefficiently duplicating the computation of identical terms. For this reason ASGs are often used as an intermediate language at a subsequent compilation stage to abstract syntax tree construction via parsing. An abstract semantic graph is typically constructed from an abstract syntax tree by a process of enrichment and abstraction. The enrichment can for example be the addition of back-pointers, edges from an identifier node (where a variable is being used) to a node representing the declaration of that variable. The abstraction can entail the removal of details which are relevant only in parsing, not for semantics.},

A widely used method for exact graph edit distance computation is based on the A* algorithm. To overcome its high memory load while traversing the search tree for storing pending solutions to be explored, we propose a depth-first graph edit distance algorithm which requires less memory and searching time. An evaluation of all possible solutions is performed without explicitly enumerating them all. Candidates are discarded using an upper and lower bounds strategy. A solid experimental study is proposed; experiments on a publicly available database empirically demonstrated that our approach is better than the A* graph edit distance computation in terms of speed, accuracy and classification rate.},

However, due to strong alternating effects between the resulting modules and products, methods and tools are required that enable engineers to use specific views in which the respective information can be linked and retrieved according to the situation. Within the scope of this paper, the model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach is used to model the complex real-world problem of vehicle modular kits. The aim is to investigate the potentials in this context, how modular kits and products can be efficiently modeled and finally how MBSE can support modular design. In order to investigate this in detail, two extensive studies are carried out in a company over a period of three years. The studies show that modular kits lead to an increased complexity of development. Across industries and companies, the demand for reference product models is shown, which facilitate the unification of inhomogeneous partial models and serve as a knowledge repository for the development of future product generations. On this basis, a framework is derived which enables the reuse of large proportions of the product models of previous product generations. This framework is evaluated on the basis of five case studies.},

We start with graph patterns, in which a graph-structured query is matched against the data. Thereafter we discuss navigational expressions, in which patterns can be matched recursively against the graph to navigate paths of arbitrary length; we give an overview of what kinds of expressions have been proposed, and how they can be combined with graph patterns. We also discuss several semantics under which queries using the previous features can be evaluated, what effects the selection of features and semantics has on complexity, and offer examples of such features in three modern languages that are used to query graphs: SPARQL, Cypher and Gremlin. We conclude by discussing the importance of formalisation for graph query languages; a summary of what is known about SPARQL, Cypher and Gremlin in terms of expressivity and complexity; and an outline of possible future directions for the area.},

However, knowledge graphs are currently relatively simple to moderate semantic structures that are mainly a collection of factual statements. Question answering (QA) benchmarks and systems were so far mainly geared towards encyclopedic knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and Wikidata. We present SciQA a scientific QA benchmark for scholarly knowledge. The benchmark leverages the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) which includes almost 170,000 resources describing research contributions of almost 15,000 scholarly articles from 709 research fields. Following a bottom-up methodology, we first manually developed a set of 100 complex questions that can be answered using this knowledge graph. Furthermore, we devised eight question templates with which we automatically generated further 2465 questions, that can also be answered with the ORKG. The questions cover a range of research fields and question types and are translated into corresponding SPARQL queries over the ORKG. Based on two preliminary evaluations, we show that the resulting SciQA benchmark represents a challenging task for next-generation QA systems.

First, the approaches depend heavily on the structure and cannot be easily adapted to other KGs. Second, the availability and amount of additional domain-specific data in structured or unstructured formats has also proven to be critical in many of these systems. Such dependencies limit the applicability of KGQA systems and make their adoption difficult. A novel algorithm is D proposed, MuHeQA, that alleviates both limitations by retrieving the answer from textual content automatically generated from KGs instead of queries over them. This new approach (1) works on one or several KGs simultaneously, (2) does not require E training data what makes it is domain-independent, (3) enables the combination of knowledge graphs with unstructured information sources to build the answer, and (4) reduces the dependency on the underlying schema since it does not navigate through T structured content but only reads property values. MuHeQA extracts answers from textual summaries created by combining information related to the question from multiple knowledge bases, be them structured or not. Experiments over Wikidata and C DBpedia show that our approach achieves comparable performance to other approaches in single-fact questions while being domain and KG independent. Results raise important questions for future work about how the textual content that can be created E from knowledge graphs enables answer extraction.},

As a result, it returned to being a study task whose objective is to propose more affordable ways to accomplish the science. As part of this transition, the question arose as to whether it could continue to afford the investment in MBSE. In short, the MBSE infusion has survived and is providing clear value to the study effort. In the process, the need to remain relevant in the new environment has brought about a wave of innovation and progress. By leveraging the existing infrastructure and a modest additional investment, striking advances in the capture and analysis of designs using MBSE were achieved. The effort has reaffirmed the importance of architecting. It has successfully harnessed the synergistic relationship of architecting to system modeling. We have found that MBSE can provide greater agility than traditional methods. We have also found that a diverse `ecosystem' of modeling tools and languages (SysML, Mathematica, even Excel) is not only viable, but an important enabler of agility and adaptability. This paper will describe the successful application of MBSE in the dynamic environment of early mission formulation, the significant results produced and lessons learned in the process.},

  abstract = {A key aspect in creating models of production systems with the use of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) lies in the description of system functions. These functions should be described in a clear and standardized manner.The VDI/VDE 3682 standard for Formalised Process Description (FPD) provides a simple and easily understandable representation of processes. These processes can be conceptualized as functions within the system model, making the FPD particularly well-suited for the standardized representation of the required functions. Hence, this contribution focuses on the development of a Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) that facilitates the integration of VDI/VDE 3682 into the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The presented approach not only extends classical SysML with domain-specific requirements but also facilitates model verification through constraints modeled in Object Constraint Language (OCL). Additionally, it enables automatic serialization of process descriptions into the Extensible Markup Language (XML) using the Velocity Template Language (VTL). This serialization enables the use of process modeling in applications outside of MBSE. The approach was validated using an collar screwing use case in the major component assembly in aircraft production.},

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information (``LLM thoughts'') are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62\% over ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by {$>$}31\%. We ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both of which form complex networks.},

  abstract = {Generating clinical reports from raw recordings such as Xrays and electroencephalogram (EEG) is an essential and routine task for doctors. However, it is often time-consuming to write accurate and detailed reports. Most existing methods try to generate the whole reports from the raw input with limited success because 1) generated reports often contain errors that need manual review and correction, 2) it does not save time when doctors want to write additional information into the report, and 3) the generated reports are not customized based on individual doctors' preference. We propose CLinicAl Report Auto-completion (CLARA), an interactive method that generates reports in a sentence by sentence fashion based on doctors' anchor words and partially completed sentences. CLARA searches for most relevant sentences from existing reports as the template for the current report. The retrieved sentences are sequentially modified by combining with the input feature representations to create the final report. In our experimental evaluation CLARA achieved 0.393 CIDEr and 0.248 BLEU4 on X-ray reports and 0.482 CIDEr and 0.491 BLEU-4 for EEG reports for sentence-level generation, which is up to 35\% improvement over the best baseline. Also via our qualitative evaluation, CLARA is shown to produce reports which have a significantly higher level of approval by doctors in a user study (3.74 out of 5 for CLARA vs 2.52 out of 5 for the baseline).},

Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

This issue can be overcome by providing systems able to answer questions posed in natural language on a knowledge base, a task that is called Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) in the literature. More in detail, many KBQA systems aim at translating automatically questions into the corresponding SPARQL queries to be executed over the knowledge base to get the answers. Effective state-of-the-art KBQA systems are based on neural-machine translation but easily fail to recognize words that are Out Of the Vocabulary (OOV) of the training set. This is a serious issue while querying large ontologies where the list of entities is huge and easily evolves over time. In this paper, we present the SPARQL-QA-v2 system that combines in an innovative way Named Entity Linking, Named Entity Recognition, and Neural Machine Translation for addressing the problem of generating SPARQL queries from questions posed in natural language. We demonstrate empirically that SPARQL-QA-v2 is effective and resilient to OOV words and delivers state-of-the-art performance in well-known datasets for question answering over DBpedia and Wikidata knowledge bases.},

Customized views satisfy information needs by focusing on a particular concern, and filtering out information that is not relevant to this concern. For a broad establishment of view-based approaches, an automated solution to deal with separate metamodels and the high complexity of model transformations is necessary. In this paper, we present the ModelJoin approach for the rapid creation of views.

The large volume of data in enterprises, and sometimes the lack of knowledge of the schemas aggravates this problem. Similar to how we navigate the Web, we propose to identify semantic links that assist analysts in their discovery tasks. These links relate tables to each other, to facilitate navigating the schemas. They also relate data to external data sources, such as ontologies and dictionaries, to help explain the schema meaning. We materialize the links in an enterprise knowledge graph, where they become available to analysts. The main challenge is how to find pairs of objects that are semantically related. We propose SEMPROP, a DAG of different components that find links based on syntactic and semantic similarities. SEMPROP is commanded by a semantic matcher which leverages word embeddings to find objects that are semantically related. We introduce coherent group, a technique to combine word embeddings that works better than other state of the art combination alternatives. We implement SEMPROP as part of Aurum, a data discovery system we are building, and conduct user studies, real deployments and a quantitative evaluation to understand the benefits of links for data discovery tasks, as well as the benefits of SEMPROP and coherent groups to find those links.},

In this work, we propose to directly model the two-way flow of interactions between the questions and the KB via a novel Bidirectional Attentive Memory Network, called BAMnet. Requiring no external resources and only very few hand-crafted features, on the WebQuestions benchmark, our method significantly outperforms existing information-retrieval based methods, and remains competitive with (hand-crafted) semantic parsing based methods.

  abstract = {Semantic parsing is the task of converting natural language utterances into machine interpretable meaning representations which can be executed against a real-world environment such as a database. Scaling semantic parsing to arbitrary domains faces two interrelated challenges: obtaining broad coverage training data effectively and cheaply; and developing a model that generalizes to compositional utterances and complex intentions. We address these challenges with a framework which allows to elicit training data from a domain ontology and bootstrap a neural parser which recursively builds derivations of logical forms. In our framework meaning representations are described by sequences of natural language templates, where each template corresponds to a decomposed fragment of the underlying meaning representation. Although artificial, templates can be understood and paraphrased by humans to create natural utterances, resulting in parallel triples of utterances, meaning representations, and their decompositions. These allow us to train a neural semantic parser which learns to compose rules in deriving meaning representations. We crowdsource training data on six domains, covering both single-turn utterances which exhibit rich compositionality, and sequential utterances where a complex task is procedurally performed in steps. We then develop neural semantic parsers which perform such compositional tasks. In general, our approach allows to deploy neural semantic parsers quickly and cheaply from a given domain ontology.},

However, these methods exhibit limited retrieval accuracy when faced with numerous indistinguishable documents, presenting notable challenges in their practical application. In response to these emerging challenges, we present HiQA, an advanced multi-document question-answering (MDQA) framework that integrates cascading metadata into content and a multi-route retrieval mechanism.

Previous works mostly focus on a simple setting that is to generate questions from a single KG triple. In this work, we focus on a more realistic setting where we aim to generate questions from a KG subgraph and target answers. In addition, most previous works built on either RNN- or Transformer-based models to encode a linearized KG subgraph, which totally discards the explicit structure information of a KG subgraph. To address this issue, we propose to apply a bidirectional Graph2Seq model to encode the KG subgraph. Furthermore, we enhance our RNN decoder with a node-level copying mechanism to allow direct copying of node attributes from the KG subgraph to the output question. Both automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate that our model achieves new state-of-the-art scores, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin on two QG benchmarks. Experimental results also show that our QG model can consistently benefit the question-answering (QA) task as a means of data augmentation.},

  abstract = {NASA's Human Research Program's (HRP) Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element adopted Systems Engineering (SE) principles and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools to capture the system functions, system architecture, requirements, interfaces, and clinical capabilities for a future exploration medical system. There are many different stakeholders who may use the information in the model: systems engineers, clinicians (physicians, nurses, and pharmacists), scientists, and program managers. Many of these individuals do not have access to MBSE modeling tools or have never used these tools. Many of these individuals (clinicians, scientists, even program managers) may have no experience with SE in general let alone interpreting a systems model. The challenge faced by ExMC was how to present the content in the model to non-modelers in a way they could understand with limited to no training in MBSE or the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) without using the modeling tool. Therefore, from the model, ExMC created an HTML report that is accessible to anyone with a browser. When creating the HTML report, the ExMC SE team talked to stakeholders and received their feedback on what content they wanted and how to display this content. Factoring in feedback, the report arranges the content in a way that not only directs readers through the SE process taken to derive the requirements, but also helps them to understand the fundamental steps in an SE approach. The report includes links to source information (i.e., NASA documentation that describes levels of care) and other SE deliverables (e.g., Concept of Operations). These links were provided to aid in the understanding of how the team created this content through a methodical SE approach. This paper outlines the process used to develop the model, the data chosen to share with stakeholders, many of the model elements used in the report, the review process stakeholders followed, the comments received from the stakeholders, and the lessons ExMC learned through producing this HTML report.},

  abstract = {Existing knowledge graph (KG) embedding models have primarily focused on static KGs. However, real-world KGs do not remain static, but rather evolve and grow in tandem with the development of KG applications. Consequently, new facts and previously unseen entities and relations continually emerge, necessitating an embedding model that can quickly learn and transfer new knowledge through growth. Motivated by this, we delve into an expanding field of KG embedding in this paper, i.e., lifelong KG embedding. We consider knowledge transfer and retention of the learning on growing snapshots of a KG without having to learn embeddings from scratch. The proposed model includes a masked KG autoencoder for embedding learning and update, with an embedding transfer strategy to inject the learned knowledge into the new entity and relation embeddings, and an embedding regularization method to avoid catastrophic forgetting. To investigate the impacts of different aspects of KG growth, we construct four datasets to evaluate the performance of lifelong KG embedding. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art inductive and lifelong embedding baselines.},

In contrast to the latter, the core reasoning problems for DLs are (usually) decidable, and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems. There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy description logics, and each description logic features a different balance between expressive power and reasoning complexity by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors. DLs are used in artificial intelligence to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain (known as terminological knowledge). It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web: the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and its profiles are based on DLs. The most notable application of DLs and OWL is in biomedical informatics where DL assists in the codification of biomedical knowledge.},

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters{\textasciitilde}(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3\% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the field of neural machine translation (NMT) for SPARQL query generation has witnessed significant growth. Incorporating the copy mechanism with traditional encoder-decoder architectures and using pre-trained encoderdecoders and large language models have set new performance benchmarks. This paper presents various experiments that replicate and expand upon recent NMT-based SPARQL generation studies, comparing pre-trained language models (PLMs), non-pretrained language models (NPLMs), and large language models (LLMs), highlighting the impact of question annotation and the copy mechanism and testing various fine-tuning methods using LLMs. In particular, we provide a systematic error analysis of the models and test their generalization ability. Our study demonstrates that the copy mechanism yields significant performance enhancements for most PLMs and NPLMs. Annotating the data is pivotal to generating correct URIs, with the "tag-within" strategy emerging as the most effective approach. Additionally, our findings reveal that the primary source of errors stems from incorrect URIs in SPARQL queries that are sometimes replaced with hallucinated URIs when using base models. This does not happen using the copy mechanism, but it sometimes leads to selecting wrong URIs among candidates. Finally, the performance of the tested LLMs fell short of achieving the desired outcomes.},

Traditionally, entity linking and relation linking have been performed either as dependent sequential tasks or as independent parallel tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework called EARL, which performs entity linking and relation linking as a joint task. EARL implements two different solution strategies for which we provide a comparative analysis in this paper: The first strategy is a formalisation of the joint entity and relation linking tasks as an instance of the Generalised Travelling Salesman Problem (GTSP). In order to be computationally feasible, we employ approximate GTSP solvers. The second strategy uses machine learning in order to exploit the connection density between nodes in the knowledge graph. It relies on three base features and re-ranking steps in order to predict entities and relations. We compare the strategies and evaluate them on a dataset with 5000 questions. Both strategies significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art approaches for entity and relation linking.},

Particularly in the era of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), the powerful capacity of retrieval in providing additional knowledge enables RAG to assist existing generative AI in producing high-quality outputs. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary abilities in language understanding and generation, while still facing inherent limitations, such as hallucinations and out-ofdate internal knowledge. Given the powerful abilities of RAG in providing the latest and helpful auxiliary information, RetrievalAugmented Large Language Models (RA-LLMs) have emerged to harness external and authoritative knowledge bases, rather than solely relying on the model's internal knowledge, to augment the generation quality of LLMs. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies in RA-LLMs, covering three primary technical perspectives: architectures, training strategies, and applications. As the preliminary knowledge, we briefly introduce the foundations and recent advances of LLMs. Then, to illustrate the practical significance of RAG for LLMs, we systematically review mainstream relevant work by their architectures, training strategies, and application areas, detailing specifically the challenges of each and the corresponding capabilities of RA-LLMs. Finally, to deliver deeper insights, we discuss current limitations and several promising directions for future research.

  abstract = {The Semantic Web (SW) is now made of billions of triples, which are available as Linked Open Data (LOD) or as RDF stores. The SPARQL query language provides a very expressive way to search and explore this wealth of semantic data. However, userfriendly interfaces are needed to bridge the gap between end-users and SW formalisms. Navigation-based interfaces and natural language interfaces require no or little training, but they cover a small fragment of SPARQL's expressivity. We propose SQUALL, a query and update language that provides the full expressiveness of SPARQL 1.1 through a flexible controlled natural language (e.g., solution modifiers through superlatives, relational algebra through coordinations, filters through comparatives). A comprehensive and modular definition is given as a Montague grammar, and an evaluation of naturalness is done on the QALD challenge. SQUALL is conceived as a component of natural language interfaces, to be combined with lexicons, guided input, and contextual disambiguation. It is available as a Web service that translates SQUALL sentences to SPARQL, and submits them to SPARQL endpoints (e.g., DBpedia), therefore ensuring SW compliance, and leveraging the efficiency of SPARQL engines.},

However, the subject still carries an important weight and has been written about by many notable mathematicians. Typically, they are motivated by a desire to set a research agenda to direct efforts to specific problems, or a wish to clarify, update and extrapolate the way that subdisciplines relate to the general discipline of mathematics and its possibilities. Examples of agendas pushing for progress in specific areas in the future, historical and recent, include  Felix Klein's Erlangen program, Hilbert's problems, Langlands program, and the Millennium Prize Problems. In the Mathematics Subject Classification section 01Axx History of mathematics and mathematicians, subsection 01A67 is titled Future prospectives. The accuracy of predictions about mathematics has varied widely and has proceeded very closely to that of technology.  As such, it is important to keep in mind that many of the predictions by researchers below may be misguided or turn out to be untrue.},

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the models, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval , the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the-art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces the metrics and benchmarks for assessing RAG models, along with the most up-to-date evaluation framework. In conclusion, the paper delineates prospective avenues for research, including the identification of challenges, the expansion of multi-modalities, and the progression of the RAG infrastructure and its ecosystem. 1.},

We show that knowledge graph embedding is naturally expressed in the topological and categorical language of {\textbackslash}textit\{cellular sheaves\}: a knowledge graph embedding can be described as an approximate global section of an appropriate {\textbackslash}textit\{knowledge sheaf\} over the graph, with consistency constraints induced by the knowledge graph's schema. This approach provides a generalized framework for reasoning about knowledge graph embedding models and allows for the expression of a wide range of prior constraints on embeddings. Further, the resulting embeddings can be easily adapted for reasoning over composite relations without special training. We implement these ideas to highlight the benefits of the extensions inspired by this new perspective.},

Current UDA approaches learn domain-invariant features by aligning source and target feature spaces through statistical discrepancy minimization or adversarial training. However, these constraints could lead to the distortion of semantic feature structures and loss of class discriminability. In this article, we introduce a novel prompt learning paradigm for UDA, named domain adaptation via prompt learning (DAPrompt). In contrast to prior works, our approach learns the underlying label distribution for target domain rather than aligning domains. The main idea is to embed domain information into prompts, a form of representation generated from natural language, which is then used to perform classification. This domain information is shared only by images from the same domain, thereby dynamically adapting the classifier according to each domain. By adopting this paradigm, we show that our model not only outperforms previous methods on several cross-domain benchmarks but also is very efficient to train and easy to implement.},

  abstract = {Semantic Web Technologies (SWTs) provide an approach to the structuring and understanding of data. SWTs utilize ontologies, reasoners, and query languages to structure existing knowledge, validate knowledge, and infer new knowledge. Ontologies in particular play a central role in enabling reusability and interoperability between domains. A common way to organize ontologies and their dependencies is in a layered ontology stack. These layers often incorporate top-level, core and domain ontologies. Libraries of standard instances can also be used. Federating the conceptualization of a domain across upper- and lower-level ontologies improves the reusability of higher-level terminology in other domains, and therefore improves interoperability between them. The University of Arizona Ontology Stack (UAOS) is a layered, modular ontology stack that has been developed to support digital engineering activities at the University of Arizona. It is based on the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), and currently comprises five core ontologies and 12 domain ontologies. The UAOS reuses existing ontologies and standards wherever possible. The core ontologies, for example, are based on the Common Core Ontologies, developed at CUBRC, and the Provenance Notation (PROV-N), a W3C standard. Domain ontologies include the System Architecture Ontology, based on ISO 42010, and the Orbits and Trajectories Ontology, based on CUBRC's Space Object Ontology. In this paper, we report on the development of the UAOS, present examples of how it has been used to support digital engineering research, discuss the challenges of integrating ontologies from multiple sources into a cohesive stack, and highlight topics of interest for future research.},

Improvement has since been made in many downstream tasks, including natural language interface to web APIs, text-to-SQL generation, among others. However, despite the close connection shared with these tasks, research on question answering over knowledge bases (KBQA) has comparatively been progressing slowly. We identify and attribute this to two unique challenges of KBQA, schema-level complexity and fact-level complexity. In this survey, we situate KBQA in the broader literature of semantic parsing and give a comprehensive account of how existing KBQA approaches attempt to address the unique challenges. Regardless of the unique challenges, we argue that we can still take much inspiration from the literature of semantic parsing, which has been overlooked by existing research on KBQA. Based on our discussion, we can better understand the bottleneck of current KBQA research and shed light on promising directions for KBQA to keep up with the literature of semantic parsing, particularly in the era of pre-trained language models.},

  abstract = {Prompts for pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performance by bridging the gap between pre-training tasks and various downstream tasks. Among these methods, prompt tuning, which freezes PLMs and only tunes soft prompts, provides an efficient and effective solution for adapting large-scale PLMs to downstream tasks. However, prompt tuning is yet to be fully explored. In our pilot experiments, we find that prompt tuning performs comparably with conventional full-model fine-tuning when downstream data are sufficient, whereas it performs much worse under few-shot learning settings, which may hinder the application of prompt tuning in practice. We attribute this low performance to the manner of initializing soft prompts. Therefore, in this work, we propose to pre-train prompts by adding soft prompts into the pre-training stage to obtain a better initialization. We name this Pre-trained Prompt Tuning framework "PPT". To ensure the generalization of PPT, we formulate similar classification tasks into a unified task form and pre-train soft prompts for this unified task. Extensive experiments show that tuning pre-trained prompts for downstream tasks can reach or even outperform full-model fine-tuning under both full-data and few-shot settings. Our approach is effective and efficient for using large-scale PLMs in practice.},

Mitigation strategies to deal with turnover tend to disrupt and increase workloads for developers. In this work, we suggest that through code review recommendation we can distribute knowledge and mitigate turnover while more evenly distributing review workload. We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review. Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover. Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover. Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender. Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer. In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge. For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3\%, reduce workload concentration, -12\%, and reduce the files at risk, -28\%. We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.

To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topicsensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared. By using linear combinations of these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate context-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. We describe techniques for efficiently implementing a large-scale search system based on the topic-sensitive PageRank scheme.},

Two types of transformer encoders are compared, a multilingual encoder and language-specific encoders. Our dependency tree parsing (DTP) approach generates only primary dependencies to form trees whereas our dependency graph parsing (DGP) approach handles both primary and secondary dependencies to form graphs. Since DGP does not guarantee the generated graphs are acyclic, the ensemble algorithm is designed to add secondary arcs predicted by DGP to primary arcs predicted by DTP. Our results show that models using the multilingual encoder outperform ones using the language specific encoders for most languages. Moreover, the ensemble models generally show higher labeled attachment score on enhanced dependencies (ELAS) than the DTP and DGP models. As the result, our best parsing models rank the third place on the macro-average ELAS over 17 languages.},

These accounts are often wildly optimistic, understating outstanding challenges while turning a blind eye to the human labor that undergirds and sustains ostensibly ``automated'' services. This long-standing focus on purely automated methods unnecessarily cedes a promising design space: one in which computational assistance augments and enriches, rather than replaces, people's intellectual work. This tension between human agency and machine automation poses vital challenges for design and engineering. In this work, we consider the design of systems that enable rich, adaptive interaction between people and algorithms. We seek to balance the often-complementary strengths and weaknesses of each, while promoting human control and skillful action. We share case studies of interactive systems we have developed in three arenas---data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and natural language translation---that integrate proactive computational support into interactive systems. To improve outcomes and support learning by both people and machines, we describe the use of shared representations of tasks augmented with predictive models of human capabilities and actions. We conclude with a discussion of future prospects and scientific frontiers for intelligence augmentation research.},

In contrast, we develop a flexible question-answering framework targeting real-world textual graphs, applicable to multiple applications including scene graph understanding, common sense reasoning, and knowledge graph reasoning. Toward this goal, we first develop our Graph Question Answering (GraphQA) benchmark with data collected from different tasks. Then, we propose our G-Retriever approach, which integrates the strengths of GNNs, LLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and can be fine-tuned to enhance graph understanding via soft prompting. To resist hallucination and to allow for textual graphs that greatly exceed the LLM's context window size, G-Retriever performs RAG over a graph by formulating this task as a Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree optimization problem. Empirical evaluations show that our method outperforms baselines on textual graph tasks from multiple domains, scales well with larger graph sizes, and resists hallucination.

  abstract = {Multi-hop Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to find the answer entities that are multiple hops away in the Knowledge Base (KB) from the entities in the question. A major challenge is the lack of supervision signals at intermediate steps. Therefore, multi-hop KBQA algorithms can only receive the feedback from the final answer, which makes the learning unstable or ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose a novel teacher-student approach for the multi-hop KBQA task. In our approach, the student network aims to find the correct answer to the query, while the teacher network tries to learn intermediate supervision signals for improving the reasoning capacity of the student network. The major novelty lies in the design of the teacher network, where we utilize both forward and backward reasoning to enhance the learning of intermediate entity distributions. By considering bidirectional reasoning, the teacher network can produce more reliable intermediate supervision signals, which can alleviate the issue of spurious reasoning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on the KBQA task. The code to reproduce our analysis is available at https://github.com/RichardHGL/WSDM2021\_NSM.},

Adoption of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) continues to grow in industry and government, and MBSE continues to be a major research theme in the systems engineering community. In fact, MBSE remains a central element in the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE)'s vision for 2025. Examining systems engineering literature, this paper presents an assessment of the extent to which benefits and value of MBSE are supported by empirical evidence. A systematic review of research and practice papers in major systems engineering archival journals and conference proceedings was conducted. Evidence was categorized in four types, two of which inductively emerged from the results: measured, observed (without a formal measurement process), perceived (claimed without evidence), and backed by other references. Results indicate that two thirds of claimed MBSE benefits are only supported by perceived evidence, while only two papers reported measured evidence. The aggregate assessment presented in this paper indicates that claims about the value and benefits of MBSE are mainly based on expectation. We argue that evidence supporting the value and benefits of MBSE remains inconclusive.},

Most practising software architects must operate within the confines of a prescribed architecture framework (AF) or architecture description language (ADL) as dictated by their organization or client. Current AFs and ADLs are defined with varying degrees of rigour and offer varying levels of tool support; furthermore, these resources are often closed, making it difficult for the architect to tailor a representational solution to the specific challenges of the project at hand.},

This practice leads to a loss of knowledge that impedes later activities like design changes, impact analysis, and reuse. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) frameworks support the development of increasingly complex systems but must address the problem of capitalization on architectural knowledge. To this end the "Decision Ontology for System Architectures (DOSA)" is developed to provide a formalized data model to capture system architecture decisions. DOSA is developed through a synthesis of decisions observed while developing an architecture model for a preliminary study of a novel satellite navigation system at Airbus Defence and Space. The approach is integrated into an MBSE framework enabling engineers to capture decisions that influence the architecture's characteristics while developing the system model and imminently trace decision to artifacts of the system architecture. Subsequent visual inspection and formal querying of the decision graph facilitates the analysis of made decisions, and their interrelations.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems built on incomplete or biased data will often exhibit problematic outcomes. Current methods of data analysis, particularly before model development, are costly and not standardized. The Dataset Nutrition Label (the Label) is a diagnostic framework that lowers the barrier to standardized data analysis by providing a distilled yet comprehensive overview of dataset "ingredients" before AI model development. Building a Label that can be applied across domains and data types requires that the framework itself be flexible and adaptable; as such, the Label is comprised of diverse qualitative and quantitative modules generated through multiple statistical and probabilistic modelling backends, but displayed in a standardized format. To demonstrate and advance this concept, we generated and published an open source prototype with seven sample modules on the ProPublica Dollars for Docs dataset. The benefits of the Label are manyfold. For data specialists, the Label will drive more robust data analysis practices, provide an efficient way to select the best dataset for their purposes, and increase the overall quality of AI models as a result of more robust training datasets and the ability to check for issues at the time of model development. For those building and publishing datasets, the Label creates an expectation of explanation, which will drive better data collection practices. We also explore the limitations of the Label, including the challenges of generalizing across diverse datasets, and the risk of using "ground truth" data as a comparison dataset. We discuss ways to move forward given the limitations identified. Lastly, we lay out future directions for the Dataset Nutrition Label project, including research and public policy agendas to further advance consideration of the concept.},

As such, MDE enables different stakeholders of business applications to participate in the engineering process. Until now however, MDE does not penetrate phases beyond generation and deployment such as monitoring, analysis, and reporting. To display information from runtime and analytics it would be interesting if reporting could utilize models from design time. Therefore, this paper presents model-based reporting (MbR). Bridging the gap between reporting and design, it enables stakeholders to intuitively specify the reporting through a domain-specific language (DSL) while accelerating development cycles. In nonmodel-driven settings, MbR can help to introduce models as a first step towards MDE.},

This phenomenon poses substantial challenges to their practical deployment and raises concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios, which attracts increasing attention to detect and mitigate these hallucinations. In this survey, we aim to provide a thorough and in-depth overview of recent advances in the field of LLM hallucinations. We begin with an innovative taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Additionally, representative approaches designed to mitigate hallucinations are introduced accordingly. Finally, we analyze the challenges that highlight the current limitations and formulate open questions, aiming to delineate pathways for future research on hallucinations in LLMs.},

We use the programs to gain tight control over the answer distribution and present a new tunable smoothing technique to mitigate question biases. Accompanying the dataset is a suite of new metrics that evaluate essential qualities such as consistency, grounding and plausibility. A careful analysis is performed for baselines as well as state-of-the-art models, providing fine-grained results for different question types and topologies. Whereas a blind LSTM obtains a mere 42.1\%, and strong VQA models achieve 54.1\%, human performance tops at 89.3\%, offering ample opportunity for new research to explore.

  abstract = {An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.},

  abstract = {Deep learning approaches to semantic parsing require a large amount of labeled data, but annotating complex logical forms is costly. Here, we propose Syntactic Question Abstraction and Retrieval (SQAR), a method to build a neural semantic parser that translates a natural language (NL) query to a SQL logical form (LF) with less than 1,000 annotated examples. SQAR first retrieves a logical pattern from the train data by computing the similarity between NL queries and then grounds a lexical information on the retrieved pattern in order to generate the final LF. We validate SQAR by training models using various small subsets of WikiSQL train data achieving up to 4.9\% higher LF accuracy compared to the previous state-of-the-art models on WikiSQL test set. We also show that by using query-similarity to retrieve logical pattern, SQAR can leverage a paraphrasing dataset achieving up to 5.9\% higher LF accuracy compared to the case where SQAR is trained by using only WikiSQL data. In contrast to a simple pattern classification approach, SQAR can generate unseen logical patterns upon the addition of new examples without re-training the model. We also discuss an ideal way to create cost efficient and robust train datasets when the data distribution can be approximated under a data-hungry setting.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has been the answer to many machine learning problems during the past two decades. However, it comes with two significant constraints: dependency on extensive labeled data and training costs. Transfer learning in deep learning, known as Deep Transfer Learning (DTL), attempts to reduce such reliance and costs by reusing obtained knowledge from a source data/task in training on a target data/task. Most applied DTL techniques are network/model-based approaches. These methods reduce the dependency of deep learning models on extensive training data and drastically decrease training costs. Moreover, the training cost reduction makes DTL viable on edge devices with limited resources. Like any new advancement, DTL methods have their own limitations, and a successful transfer depends on specific adjustments and strategies for different scenarios. This paper reviews the concept, definition, and taxonomy of deep transfer learning and well-known methods. It investigates the DTL approaches by reviewing applied DTL techniques in the past five years and a couple of experimental analyses of DTLs to discover the best practice for using DTL in different scenarios. Moreover, the limitations of DTLs (catastrophic forgetting dilemma and overly biased pre-trained models) are discussed, along with possible solutions and research trends.},

  abstract = {Multi-hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graph (KGQA) aims to find the answer entities that are multiple hops away from the topic entities mentioned in a natural language question on a large-scale Knowledge Graph (KG). To cope with the vast search space, existing work usually adopts a two-stage approach: it first retrieves a relatively small subgraph related to the question and then performs the reasoning on the subgraph to find the answer entities accurately. Although these two stages are highly related, previous work employs very different technical solutions for developing the retrieval and reasoning models, neglecting their relatedness in task essence. In this paper, we propose UniKGQA, a novel approach for multi-hop KGQA task, by unifying retrieval and reasoning in both model architecture and parameter learning. For model architecture, UniKGQA consists of a semantic matching module based on a pre-trained language model (PLM) for question-relation semantic matching, and a matching information propagation module to propagate the matching information along the directed edges on KGs. For parameter learning, we design a shared pre-training task based on questionrelation matching for both retrieval and reasoning models, and then propose retrieval- and reasoning-oriented fine-tuning strategies. Compared with previous studies, our approach is more unified, tightly relating the retrieval and reasoning stages. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method on the multi-hop KGQA task.

Efficient and simple methods to query them are essential and must not be restricted to only those who have expertise in formal query languages. The field of semantic parsing deals with converting natural language utterances to logical forms that can be easily executed on a knowledge base. In this survey, we examine the various components of a semantic parsing system and discuss prominent work ranging from the initial rule based methods to the current neural approaches to program synthesis. We also discuss methods that operate using varying levels of supervision and highlight the key challenges involved in the learning of such systems.},

Despite promising results, paraphrases generated by these models mostly suffer from lack of quality and diversity. To address these problems, we propose a novel retrieval-based method for paraphrase generation. Our model first retrieves a paraphrase pair similar to the input sentence from a pre-defined index. With its novel editor module, the model then paraphrases the input sequence by editing it using the extracted relations between the retrieved pair of sentences. In order to have fine-grained control over the editing process, our model uses the newly introduced concept of Micro Edit Vectors. It both extracts and exploits these vectors using the attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture. Experimental results show the superiority of our paraphrase generation method in terms of both automatic metrics, and human evaluation of relevance, grammaticality, and diversity of generated paraphrases.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel unsupervised technique that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to determine the most suitable dense retriever for a specific test(target) corpus. Selecting the appropriate dense retriever is vital for numerous IR applications that employ these retrievers, trained on public datasets, to encode or conduct searches within a new private target corpus. The effectiveness of a dense retriever can significantly diminish when applied to a target corpus that diverges in domain or task from the original training set. The problem becomes more pronounced in cases where the target corpus is unlabeled, e.g. in zero-shot scenarios, rendering direct evaluation of the model's effectiveness on the target corpus unattainable. Therefore, the unsupervised selection of an optimally pre-trained dense retriever, especially under conditions of domain shift, emerges as a critical challenge. Existing methodologies for ranking dense retrievers fall short in addressing these domain shift scenarios. To tackle this, our method capitalizes on LLMs to create pseudo-relevant queries, labels, and reference lists by analyzing a subset of documents from the target corpus. This allows for the ranking of dense retrievers based on their performance with these pseudo-relevant signals. Significantly, this strategy is the first to depend exclusively on the target corpus data, removing the necessity for training data and test labels. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach by compiling a comprehensive pool of cutting-edge dense retrievers and comparing our method against traditional dense retriever selection benchmarks. The findings reveal that our proposed solution surpasses the existing benchmarks in both the selection and ranking of dense retrievers.},

When trained on a large-scale graph dataset (PCQM4Mv2), our method coined Tokenized Graph Transformer (TokenGT) achieves significantly better results compared to GNN baselines and competitive results compared to Transformer variants with sophisticated graph-specific inductive bias.

  abstract = {A variety of knowledge graph embedding approaches have been developed. Most of them obtain embeddings by learning the structure of the knowledge graph within a link prediction setting. As a result, the embeddings reflect only the structure of a single knowledge graph, and embeddings for different knowledge graphs are not aligned, e.g., they cannot be used to find similar entities across knowledge graphs via nearest neighbor search. However, knowledge graph embedding applications such as entity disambiguation require a more global representation, i.e., a representation that is valid across multiple sources. We propose to learn universal knowledge graph embeddings from large-scale interlinked knowledge sources. To this end, we fuse large knowledge graphs based on the owl:sameAs relation such that every entity is represented by a unique identity. We instantiate our idea by computing universal embeddings based on DBpedia and Wikidata yielding embeddings for about 180 million entities, 15 thousand relations, and 1.2 billion triples. We believe our computed embeddings will support the emerging field of graph foundation models. Moreover, we develop a convenient API to provide embeddings as a service. Experiments on link prediction suggest that universal knowledge graph embeddings encode better semantics compared to embeddings computed on a single knowledge graph. For reproducibility purposes, we provide our source code and datasets open access.},

Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers to make design decisions.},

  abstract = {Automatic question generation (QG) is a useful yet challenging task in NLP. Recent neural network-based approaches represent the stateof-the-art in this task. In this work, we attempt to strengthen them significantly by adopting a holistic and novel generator-evaluator framework that directly optimizes objectives that reward semantics and structure. The generator is a sequence-to-sequence model that incorporates the structure and semantics of the question being generated. The generator predicts an answer in the passage that the question can pivot on. Employing the copy and coverage mechanisms, it also acknowledges other contextually important (and possibly rare) keywords in the passage that the question needs to conform to, while not redundantly repeating words. The evaluator model evaluates and assigns a reward to each predicted question based on its conformity to the structure of ground-truth questions. We propose two novel QG-specific reward functions for text conformity and answer conformity of the generated question. The evaluator also employs structure-sensitive rewards based on evaluation measures such as BLEU, GLEU, and ROUGE-L, which are suitable for QG. In contrast, most of the previous works only optimize the cross-entropy loss, which can induce inconsistencies between training (objective) and testing (evaluation) measures. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems on the widelyused SQuAD benchmark as per both automatic and human evaluation.},

Our research hypothesis is that the pretraining of large language models (LLMs) on vast amounts of textual data leads to the ability to parse into controlled natural language for KGQA with limited training data requirements. We devise an LLMspecific approach for semantic parsing to study this hypothesis. To conduct our study, we created a dataset that allows the comparison of one formal and two different controlled natural languages. Our analysis shows that training data requirements are indeed substantially reduced when using controlled natural languages, which is relevant since collecting and maintaining high-quality KGQA semantic parsing training data is very expensive and time-consuming.},

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

Although many neural modeling efforts have greatly improved the performance, it still suffers from the data scarcity issue. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic parser for domain adaptation, where we have much fewer annotated data in the target domain compared to the source domain. Our semantic parser benefits from a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework, thus can provide different and accurate treatments for the two stages, i.e., focusing on domain invariant and domain specific information, respectively. In the coarse stage, our novel domain discrimination component and domain relevance attention encourage the model to learn transferable domain general structures. In the fine stage, the model is guided to concentrate on domain related details. Experiments on a benchmark dataset show that our method consistently outperforms several popular domain adaptation strategies.  Additionally, we show that our model can well exploit limited target data to capture the difference between the source and target domain, even when the target domain has far fewer training instances.},

  abstract = {This thesis explores challenges in semantic parsing, specifically focusing on scenarios with limited data and computational resources. It offers solutions using techniques like automatic data curation, knowledge transfer, active learning, and continual learning. For tasks with no parallel training data, the thesis proposes generating synthetic training examples from structured database schemas. When there is abundant data in a source domain but limited parallel data in a target domain, knowledge from the source is leveraged to improve parsing in the target domain. For multilingual situations with limited data in the target languages, the thesis introduces a method to adapt parsers using a limited human translation budget. Active learning is applied to select source-language samples for manual translation, maximizing parser performance in the target language. In addition, an alternative method is also proposed to utilize machine translation services, supplemented by human-translated data, to train a more effective parser. When computational resources are limited, a continual learning approach is introduced to minimize training time and computational memory. This maintains the parser's efficiency in previously learned tasks while adapting it to new tasks, mitigating the problem of catastrophic forgetting. Overall, the thesis provides a comprehensive set of methods to improve semantic parsing in resource-constrained conditions.},

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various domains, which makes applying LLMs to graphs particularly appealing. However, directly applying LLMs to graph modalities presents unique challenges due to the discrepancy and mismatch between the graph and text modalities. Hence, to further investigate LLMs' potential for comprehending graph information, we introduce GraphPrompter, a novel framework designed to align graph information with LLMs via soft prompts. Specifically, GraphPrompter consists of two main components: a graph neural network to encode complex graph information and an LLM that effectively processes textual information. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets under node classification and link prediction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The GraphPrompter framework unveils the substantial capabilities of LLMs as predictors in graph-related tasks, enabling researchers to utilize LLMs across a spectrum of real-world graph scenarios more effectively1.},

  abstract = {Foundation models have emerged as critical components in a variety of artificial intelligence applications, and showcase significant success in natural language processing and several other domains. Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models to generalize and adapt motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.},

In fact, one can use null prompts, prompts that contain neither task-specific templates nor training examples, and achieve competitive accuracy to manually-tuned prompts across a wide range of tasks. While finetuning LMs does introduce new parameters for each downstream task, we show that this memory overhead can be substantially reduced: finetuning only the bias terms can achieve comparable or better accuracy than standard finetuning while only updating 0.1\% of the parameters. All in all, we recommend finetuning LMs for few-shot learning as it is more accurate, robust to different prompts, and can be made nearly as efficient as using frozen LMs.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities in complex tasks. However, they lack up-to-date knowledge and experience hallucinations during reasoning, which can lead to incorrect reasoning processes and diminish their performance and trustworthiness. Knowledge graphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. Nevertheless, existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods only treat KGs as factual knowledge bases and overlook the importance of their structural information for reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel method called reasoning on graphs (RoG) that synergizes LLMs with KGs to enable faithful and interpretable reasoning. Specifically, we present a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, where RoG first generates relation paths grounded by KGs as faithful plans. These plans are then used to retrieve valid reasoning paths from the KGs for LLMs to conduct faithful reasoning. Furthermore, RoG not only distills knowledge from KGs to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs through training but also allows seamless integration with any arbitrary LLMs during inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that RoG achieves state-of-the-art performance on KG reasoning tasks and generates faithful and interpretable reasoning results.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has continued to develop as a standard for designing, managing, and maintaining increasingly complex systems. Unlike the document centric approach, MBSE puts the model at the heart of system design. Among the various MBSE language development efforts, ``Systems Modeling Language (SysML)'', is the most anticipated and broadly utilized in the research and in industrial practice. SysML originated from Unified Modeling Language (UML) and follows the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM). SysML diagrams help users create various systems engineering artifacts, including requirements, use cases, operational concepts, system architecture, system behaviors, and parametric analyses of a system model. In the early days of implementation, MBSE languages, including SysML, typically relied on static viewpoints and limited simulation support to depict and analyze a system model. Due the continuous improvement efforts and new implementation approaches by researchers and organizations, SysML has advanced vastly to encompass dynamic viewpoints, in-situ simulation and enable integration with external modeling and simulation (M\&S) tools. Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a user interactive and immersive visualization technology and can depict reality in a virtual environment at different levels of fidelity. VR can play a crucial role in developing dynamic and interactive viewpoints to improve the MBSE approach. In this research paper, the authors developed and implemented a methodology for integrating SysML and VR, enabling tools to achieve three dimensional viewpoints, an immersive user experience and early design evaluations of the system of interest (SOI). The key components of the methodology being followed in this research paper are the SysML, a VR environment, extracted data and scripting languages. The authors initially developed a SysML for a ground-based telescope system following the four pillars of SysML: Structure, Requirements, Behavior and Parametrics. The SysML diagram components are exported from the model using the velocity template language and then fed into a virtual reality game engine. Then, the SysML diagrams are visualized in the VR environment to enable better comprehension and interaction with users and Digital Twin (DT) technologies. In addition, a VR simulation scenario of space objects is generated based on the input from the SysML, and the simulation result is sent back from the VR tool into the model with the aid of parametric diagram simulation. Hence, by utilizing the developed SysML-VR integration methodology, VR environment scenarios are successfully integrated with the SysML. Finally, the research paper mentions a few limitations of the current implementation and proposes future improvements.},

We address each of these challenges and develop a set of models that shows the importance of each problem. We first develop an internal SQL benchmark to perform offline tests at Meta. We evaluate how well the Public Llama model performs. We attain a BLEU score of 53\% and 24\% for single- and multi-line predictions, respectively. This performance is consistent with prior works on imperative languages. We then fine-tune Llama on our internal data and database schemas. SqlComposeSA substantially outperforms Llama by 16 percentage points on BLEU score. SQL is often written with multiple sub queries and in a non-sequential manner. We develop SqlComposeFIM which is aware of the context before and after the line(s) that need to be completed. This fill-in-the-middle model outperform SqlComposeFIM by 35 percentage points. We also measure how often the models get the correct table names, and SqlComposeFIM is able to do this 75\% of the time a major improvement over the other two models. Aside from our scientific research, we also roll out SqlComposeFIM at Meta. SqlCompose has is used on a weekly basis by over 10k users including data scientists and software engineers, less than 1\% of users have disabled SqlCompose. We use the feedback from users to improve SqlCompose. Interesting positive themes include completing tedious or repetitive SQL clauses, suggesting boilerplate coding, and help in eliminate the need to remember difficult SQL syntax. The most significant negative themes was table and column name hallucinations, which has been reduced with the release of SqlComposeFIM. The SqlCompose models consistently outperform public and internal LLMs despite their smaller size (7 bn and 13 bn), which provides early indications that smaller specialist models can outperform larger general purpose models.},

For each source domain, the distribution over the input points as well as a hypothesis with error at most {\textbackslash}epsilon are given. The problem consists of combining these hypotheses to derive a hypothesis with small error with respect to the target domain. We present several theoretical results relating to this problem. In particular, we prove that standard convex combinations of the source hypotheses may in fact perform very poorly and that, instead, combinations weighted by the source distributions benefit from favorable theoretical guarantees. Our main result shows that, remarkably, for any fixed target function, there exists a distribution weighted combining rule that has a loss of at most {\textbackslash}epsilon with respect to any target mixture of the source distributions. We further generalize the setting from a single target function to multiple consistent target functions and show the existence of a combining rule with error at most 3{\textbackslash}epsilon. Finally, we report empirical results for a multiple source adaptation problem with a real-world dataset.},

These constraints can be too restrictive to characterize structures and node labels that are syntactically different but semantically equivalent. We propose a new class of key constraints,               Ontological Graph Keys               (OGKs) that extend conventional graph keys by ontological subgraph matching between entity labels and an external ontology.

We then study the entity matching problem with OGKs, and a practical variant with a budget on the matching cost. We develop efficient algorithms to perform entity matching based on a (budgeted) Chase procedure. Using real-world graphs, we experimentally verify the efficiency and accuracy of OGK-based entity matching.},

This work introduces a new framework, Rewrite-Retrieve-Read instead of the previous retrieve-then-read for the retrieval-augmented LLMs from the perspective of the query rewriting. Unlike prior studies focusing on adapting either the retriever or the reader, our approach pays attention to the adaptation of the search query itself, for there is inevitably a gap between the input text and the needed knowledge in retrieval. We first prompt an LLM to generate the query, then use a web search engine to retrieve contexts. Furthermore, to better align the query to the frozen modules, we propose a trainable scheme for our pipeline. A small language model is adopted as a trainable rewriter to cater to the black-box LLM reader. The rewriter is trained using the feedback of the LLM reader by reinforcement learning. Evaluation is conducted on downstream tasks, open-domain QA and multiple-choice QA. Experiments results show consistent performance improvement, indicating that our framework is proven effective and scalable, and brings a new framework for retrieval-augmented LLM.},

  abstract = {Humans (e.g., crowdworkers) have a remarkable ability in solving different tasks, by simply reading textual instructions that define them and looking at a few examples. Despite the success of the conventional supervised learning on individual datasets, such models often struggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system cannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build a model that learns a new task by understanding the human-readable instructions that define it. To study this, we introduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their human-authored instructions, and 193k task instances (input-output pairs). The instructions are obtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to create existing NLP datasets and mapped to a unified schema. Using this meta-dataset, we measure cross-task generalization by training models on seen tasks and measuring generalization to the remaining unseen ones. We adopt generative pre-trained language models to encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output. Our results indicate that models benefit from instructions when evaluated in terms of generalization to unseen tasks (19\% better for models utilizing instructions). These models, however, are far behind an estimated performance upperbound indicating significant room for more progress in this direction.},

It can be a helpful tool for chatbots for generating interesting questions as also for automating the process of question generation from a piece of text. Most modern-day systems, which are conversational, require question generation ability for identifying the user's needs and serving customers better. Generating questions in natural language is now, a more evolved task, which also includes generating questions for an image or video. In this review, we provide an overview of the research progress in automatic question generation. We also present a comprehensive literature review covering the classification of Question Generation systems by categorizing them into three broad use-cases, namely standalone question generation, visual question generation, and conversational question generation. We next discuss the datasets available for the same for each use-case.

  abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a trending technology in the building industry that can increase efficiency throughout construction. Various practical information can be obtained from BIM models during the project life cycle. However, accessing this information could be tedious and time-consuming for nontechnical users, who might have limited or no knowledge of working with BIM software. Automating the information inquiry process can potentially address this need. This research proposes an Artificial Intelligencebased framework to facilitate accessing information in BIM models. First, the framework uses a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to determine the user's question type. Simultaneously, it employs natural language processing (NLP) for syntactic analysis to find the main keywords of the user's question. Then it utilizes an ontology database such as IfcOWL and an NLP method (latent semantic analysis (LSA)) for a semantic understanding of the question. The keywords are expanded through the semantic relationship in the ontologies, and eventually, a final query is formed based on keywords and their expanded concepts. A Navisworks API is developed that employs the identified question type and its parameters to extract the results from BIM and display them to the users. The proposed platform also includes a speech recognition module for a more user-friendly interface. The results show that the speed of answering the questions on the platform is up to 5 times faster than the manual use by experts while maintaining high accuracy.},

QA-GNN [26] is one such method giving state-of-the-art performances, but is limited by its reliance on the extraction of contextual subgraph for every QA pair through entity linking and heuristics. To address this limitation, there is a growing need for more generalizable approaches to sub-graph retrieval. There has been an increasing effort of dense retrieval in the language domain [6, 11, 12] which focus on retrieving relevant information from large knowledge sources like Wikipedia through learning better data and query representations. In this work, we extend this approach to the context of graphs and build DrKG, a dense retrieval framework for Knowledge graphs in the task of question answering. Our experiments with empirical and qualitative results suggest that our framework extracts subgraphs that show improved performance on multiple datasets for commonsense QA.},

  abstract = {In computational complexity theory, a problem is NP-complete when: It is a decision problem, meaning that for any input to the problem, the output is either "yes" or "no". When the answer is "yes", this can be demonstrated through the existence of a short (polynomial length) solution. The correctness of each solution can be verified quickly (namely, in polynomial time) and a brute-force search algorithm can find a solution by trying all possible solutions. The problem can be used to simulate every other problem for which we can verify quickly that a solution is correct. In this sense, NP-complete problems are the hardest of the problems to which solutions can be verified quickly. If we could find solutions of some NP-complete problem quickly, we could quickly find the solutions of every other problem to which a given solution can be easily verified. The name "NP-complete" is short for "nondeterministic polynomial-time complete". In this name, "nondeterministic" refers to nondeterministic Turing machines, a way of mathematically formalizing the idea of a brute-force search algorithm. Polynomial time refers to an amount of time that is considered "quick" for a deterministic algorithm to check a single solution, or for a nondeterministic Turing machine to perform the whole search. "Complete" refers to the property of being able to simulate everything in the same complexity class. More precisely, each input to the problem should be associated with a set of solutions of polynomial length, the validity of each of which can be tested quickly (in polynomial time), such that the output for any input is "yes" if the solution set is non-empty and "no" if it is empty. The complexity class of problems of this form is called NP, an abbreviation for "nondeterministic polynomial time". A problem is said to be NP-hard if everything in NP can be transformed in polynomial time into it even though it may not be in NP. A problem is NP-complete if it is both in NP and NP-hard. The NP-complete problems represent the hardest problems in NP. If some NP-complete problem has a polynomial time algorithm, all problems in NP do. The set of NP-complete problems is often denoted by NP-C or NPC. Although a solution to an NP-complete problem can be verified "quickly", there is no known way to find a solution quickly. That is, the time required to solve the problem using any currently known algorithm increases rapidly as the size of the problem grows. As a consequence, determining whether it is possible to solve these problems quickly, called the P versus NP problem, is one of the fundamental unsolved problems in computer science today. While a method for computing the solutions to NP-complete problems quickly remains undiscovered, computer scientists and programmers still frequently encounter NP-complete problems. NP-complete problems are often addressed by using heuristic methods and approximation algorithms.},

Conversational AI simulates conversations with humans; however, it is limited by the data captured in the training datasets. In contrast, QASs retrieve the most recent information from a KG by understanding and translating the natural language question into a formal query supported by the database engine. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the characteristics of the existing alternatives towards combining both worlds into novel KG chatbots. Our framework compares two representative conversational models, ChatGPT and Galactica, against KGQAN, the current state-of-the-art QAS. We conduct a thorough evaluation using four real KGs across various application domains to identify the current limitations of each category of systems. Based on our findings, we propose open research opportunities to empower QASs with chatbot capabilities for KGs. All benchmarks and all raw results are available1 for further analysis.},

  abstract = {Knowledge from diverse application domains is organized as knowledge graphs (KGs) that are stored in RDF engines accessible in the web via SPARQL endpoints. Expressing a well-formed SPARQL query requires information about the graph structure and the exact URIs of its components, which is impractical for the average user. Question answering (QA) systems assist by translating natural language questions to SPARQL. Existing QA systems are typically based on application-specific human-curated rules, or require prior information, expensive pre-processing and model adaptation for each targeted KG. Therefore, they are hard to generalize to a broad set of applications and KGs. In this paper, we propose KGQAn, a universal QA system that does not need to be tailored to each target KG. Instead of curated rules, KGQAn introduces a novel formalization of question understanding as a text generation problem to convert a question into an intermediate abstract representation via a neural sequence-to-sequence model. We also develop a just-in-time linker that maps at query time the abstract representation to a SPARQL query for a specific KG, using only the publicly accessible APIs and the existing indices of the RDF store, without requiring any pre-processing. Our experiments with several real KGs demonstrate that KGQAn is easily deployed and outperforms by a large margin the state-of-the-art in terms of quality of answers and processing time, especially for arbitrary KGs, unseen during the training.},

  abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

Therefore, few-shot learning that could drastically reduce the turnaround time of building machine learning applications emerges as a low-cost solution. This survey paper comprises a representative list of recently proposed few-shot learning algorithms.

  abstract = {A parse tree or parsing tree (also known as a derivation tree or concrete syntax tree) is an ordered, rooted tree that represents the syntactic structure of a string according to some context-free grammar. The term parse tree itself is used primarily in computational linguistics; in theoretical syntax, the term syntax tree is more common. Concrete syntax trees reflect the syntax of the input language, making them distinct from the abstract syntax trees used in computer programming. Unlike Reed-Kellogg sentence diagrams used for teaching grammar, parse trees do not use distinct symbol shapes for different types of constituents. Parse trees are usually constructed based on either the constituency relation of constituency grammars (phrase structure grammars) or the dependency relation of dependency grammars. Parse trees may be generated for sentences in natural languages (see natural language processing), as well as during processing of computer languages, such as programming languages. A related concept is that of phrase marker or P-marker, as used in transformational generative grammar. A phrase marker is a linguistic expression marked as to its phrase structure. This may be presented in the form of a tree, or as a bracketed expression. Phrase markers are generated by applying phrase structure rules, and themselves are subject to further transformational rules. A set of possible parse trees for a syntactically ambiguous sentence is called a "parse forest".},

The notion of P-complete decision problems is useful in the analysis of: which problems are difficult to parallelize effectively, which problems are difficult to solve in limited space. specifically when stronger notions of reducibility than polytime-reducibility are considered. The specific type of reduction used varies and may affect the exact set of problems. Generically, reductions stronger than polynomial-time reductions are used, since all languages in P (except the empty language and the language of all strings) are P-complete under polynomial-time reductions. If we use NC reductions, that is, reductions which can operate in polylogarithmic time on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors, then all P-complete problems lie outside NC and so cannot be effectively parallelized, under the unproven assumption that NC {$\neq$} P. If we use the stronger log-space reduction, this remains true, but additionally we learn that all P-complete problems lie outside L under the weaker unproven assumption that L {$\neq$} P. In this latter case the set P-complete may be smaller.},

Recent research on the subject still lacks a proper practical understanding of the relationship between the various existing DA methods. The connection between DA methods and several important aspects of its outputs, such as lexical diversity and semantic fidelity, is also still poorly understood. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of NLP DA techniques, comparing their relative performance under different settings.

With ChatGraph, users can interact with graphs through natural language, making it easier to use and more flexible than traditional approaches. The core of ChatGraph lies in generating chains of graph analysis APIs based on the understanding of the texts and graphs inputted in the user prompts. To achieve this, ChatGraph consists of three main modules: an API retrieval module that searches for relevant APIs, a graph-aware LLM module that enables the LLM to comprehend graphs, and an API chain-oriented finetuning module that guides the LLM in generating API chains. We have implemented ChatGraph and will showcase its usability and efficiency in four scenarios using real-world graphs.},

  abstract = {Dense retrieval (DR) converts queries and documents into dense embeddings and measures the similarity between queries and documents in vector space. One of the major challenges in DR is the lack of domain-specific training data. While DR models can learn from large-scale public datasets like MS MARCO through transfer learning, evidence shows that not all DR models and domains can benefit from transfer learning. Recently, researchers have resorted to large language models (LLMs) to improve the zero-shot and few-shot DR models. However, the hard prompts or human-written prompts utilized in these works are suboptimal and the generated weak queries are often sensitive to the prompts. To tackle this, we propose soft prompt tuning for augmenting DR (SPTAR1): for each task, we leverage soft prompt-tuning to optimize a task-specific soft prompt on limited ground truth data and then prompt the LLMs to tag unlabeled documents with weak queries, yielding weak documentquery pairs to train task-specific dense retrievers. We design a filter to select high-quality example document-query pairs in the prompt to further improve the quality of weak tagged queries. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work utilizing soft prompt tuning to augment DR models. Moreover, unlike much of the existing work, ours is based on popular open-source LLMs to ensure reproducible and deterministic results. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPTAR outperforms both unsupervised baselines and the recently proposed LLMs-based augmentation method for DR.},

  abstract = {The ability to have the same experience for different user groups (i.e., accessibility) is one of the most important characteristics of Web-based systems. The same is true for Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems that provide the access to Semantic Web data via natural language interface. While following our research agenda on the multilingual aspect of accessibility of KGQA systems, we identified several ongoing challenges. One of them is the lack of multilingual KGQA benchmarks. In this work, we extend one of the most popular KGQA benchmarks - QALD-9 by introducing high-quality questions' translations to 8 languages provided by native speakers, and transferring the SPARQL queries of QALD-9 from DBpedia to Wikidata, s.t., the usability and relevance of the dataset is strongly increased. Five of the languages - Armenian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Bashkir and Belarusian - to our best knowledge were never considered in KGQA research community before. The latter two of the languages are considered as "endangered" by UNESCO. We call the extended dataset QALD-9-plus and made it available online https://github.com/Perevalov/qald\_9\_plus.},

In this article, we address systematically the formal study of the database aspects of SPARQL, concentrating in its graph pattern matching facility. We provide a compositional semantics for the core part of SPARQL, and study the complexity of the evaluation of several fragments of the language. Among other complexity results, we show that the evaluation of general SPARQL patterns is PSPACE-complete. We identify a large class of SPARQL patterns, defined by imposing a simple and natural syntactic restriction, where the query evaluation problem can be solved more efficiently. This restriction gives rise to the class of well-designed patterns. We show that the evaluation problem is coNP-complete for well-designed patterns. Moreover, we provide several rewriting rules for well-designed patterns whose application may have a considerable impact in the cost of evaluating SPARQL queries.},

In this work, we present an LLM-based approach for SPARQL query generation over Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) for the ISWC SciQA Challenge. Our approach proposes a couple of improvements to the recently published SPARQLGEN approach, that performs one-shot SPARQL query generation by augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with the relevant context within a single prompt. Similar to SPARQLGEN, we include heterogeneous data sources in the SPARQL generation prompt: a question itself, an RDF subgraph required to answer the question, and an example of a correct SPARQL query. In the current work, we focused on designing subgraph extraction algorithms, that are close to real-life scenarios of generative KGQA, and replaced the random choice of example question-query pair with similarity scoring.},

  abstract = {Early stages of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) namely requirement elicitation and requirements analysis have remained document-centric in the industry for marketdriven, complex, large-scale business applications and products. The documentation typically runs into hundreds of Natural Language (NL) text documents which requirements engineers need to sift looking for the relevant information and also maintain these documents in-sync over time -- a time-consuming and errorprone activity. Much of this difficulty can be overcome if the information is available in a structured form that is amenable to automated processing. Purposive models offer a way out. However, for easy adoption by industry practitioners, these models must be populated from NL text documents in a largely automated manner. This task is characterized by high variability with several documents containing different information conforming to different structures and styles. As a result, purposive information extractors need to be developed for each project/ product. Moreover, being an open-ended space there is no upper bound on the information extractors that need to be developed. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a document structure agnostic and meta-model agnostic tool, DocToModel, for the automated authoring of models from NL text documents. It provides a pattern mapping language to specify a mapping of structured and unstructured document information to metamodel elements, and a pattern interpreter to automate model authoring. The configurable and extensible architecture of DocToModel makes it generic and amenable to easy repurposing for other NL documents. This paper, describes the approach and illustrates its utility and efficacy on multiple real-world case studies.},

To address these weaknesses, we present SQuAD 2.0, the latest version of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD).

To overcome this challenge, in this study, we evaluate several strategies for fine-tuning the OpenLlama LLM for question answering over life science knowledge graphs. In particular, we propose an end-to-end data augmentation approach for extending a set of existing queries over a given knowledge graph towards a larger dataset of semantically enriched question-to-SPARQL query pairs, enabling fine-tuning even for datasets where these pairs are scarce. In this context, we also investigate the role of semantic "clues" in the queries, such as meaningful variable names and inline comments. Finally, we evaluate our approach over the real-world Bgee gene expression knowledge graph and we show that semantic clues can improve model performance by up to 33\% compared to a baseline with random variable names and no comments included.},

Labeled datasets required to train such parsers are expensive to collect, and are never comprehensive. As a result, for effective post-deployment domain adaptation and personalization, semantic parsers are continuously retrained to learn new user vocabulary and paraphrase variety. However, state-of-the art attention based neural parsers are slow to retrain which inhibits real time domain adaptation. Secondly, these parsers do not leverage numerous paraphrases already present in the training dataset. Designing parsers which can simultaneously maintain high accuracy and fast retraining time is challenging. In this paper, we present novel paraphrase attention based sequence-to-sequence/tree parsers which support fast near real time retraining. In addition, our parsers often boost accuracy by jointly modeling the semantic dependencies of paraphrases. We evaluate our model on benchmark datasets to demonstrate upto 9X speedup in retraining time compared to existing parsers, as well as achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.},

State-of-the-art models have reached almost perfect query generation for simple datasets. However, such progress raises the question of the ability of these models to generalize and deal with unseen question-query structures and entities. In this work, we propose copy-enhanced pre-trained models with question annotation and test the ability of several models to handle unknown question-query structures and URIs. To do so, we split two popular datasets based on unknown URIs and question-query structures. Our results show that the copy mechanism effectively allows non-pre-trained models to deal with unknown URIs, and that it also improves the results of some pre-trained models. Our results also show that, when exposed to unknown question-query structures on a simple dataset, pre-trained models significantly outperform non-pre-trained models, but both non-pre-trained and pre-trained models have a considerable drop in performance on a harder dataset. However, the copy mechanism significantly boosts the results of non-pre-trained models on all settings and of the BART pre-trained model, except for the template split on LC-QuAD 2.0 dataset.},

  abstract = {Virtual assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant often rely on a semantic parsing component to understand which action(s) to execute for an utterance spoken by its users. Traditionally, rule-based or statistical slot-filling systems have been used to parse ``simple'' queries; that is, queries that contain a single action and can be decomposed into a set of non-overlapping entities. More recently, shift-reduce parsers have been proposed to process more complex utterances. These methods, while powerful, impose specific limitations on the type of queries that can be parsed; namely, they require a query to be representable as a parse tree. In this work, we propose a unified architecture based on Sequence to Sequence models and Pointer Generator Network to handle both simple and complex queries. Unlike other works, our approach does not impose any restriction on the semantic parse schema. Furthermore, experiments show that it achieves state of the art performance on three publicly available datasets (ATIS, SNIPS, Facebook TOP), relatively improving between 3.3\% and 7.7\% in exact match accuracy over previous systems. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our approach on two internal datasets.},

  abstract = {SPARQL query generation from natural language questions is complex because it requires an understanding of both the question and underlying knowledge graph (KG) patterns. Most SPARQL query generation approaches are template-based, tailored to a specific knowledge graph and require pipelines with multiple steps, including entity and relation linking. Template-based approaches are also difficult to adapt for new KGs and require manual efforts from domain experts to construct query templates. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a new approach, dubbed SGPT, that combines the benefits of end-to-end and modular systems and leverages recent advances in large-scale language models. Specifically, we devise a novel embedding technique that can encode linguistic features from the question which enables the system to learn complex question patterns. In addition, we propose training techniques that allow the system to implicitly employ the graph-specific information (i.e., entities and relations) into the language model's parameters and generate SPARQL queries accurately. Finally, we introduce a strategy to adapt standard automatic metrics for evaluating SPARQL query generation. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SGPT over state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {Most Knowledge Graph-based Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on training data to reach their optimal performance. However, acquiring training data for supervised systems is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this, in this paper, we propose Tree-KGQA, an unsupervised KGQA system leveraging pre-trained language models and tree-based algorithms. Entity and relation linking are essential components of any KGQA system. We employ several pre-trained language models in the entity linking task to recognize the entities mentioned in the question and obtain the contextual representation for indexing. Furthermore, for relation linking we incorporate a pre-trained language model previously trained for language inference task. Finally, we introduce a novel algorithm for extracting the answer entities from a KG, where we construct a forest of interpretations and introduce tree-walking and tree disambiguation techniques. Our algorithm uses the linked relation and predicts the tree branches that eventually lead to the potential answer entities. The proposed method achieves 4.5\% and 7.1\% gains in F1 score in entity linking tasks on LC-QuAD 2.0 and LC-QuAD 2.0 (KBpearl) datasets, respectively, and a 5.4\% increase in the relation linking task on LC-QuAD 2.0 (KBpearl). The comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our unsupervised KGQA approach outperforms other supervised state-of-the-art methods on the WebQSP-WD test set (1.4\% increase in F1 score) - without training on the target dataset.},

  abstract = {The graph retrieval problem is to search in a large corpus of graphs for ones that are most similar to a query graph. A common consideration for scoring similarity is the maximum common subgraph (MCS) between the query and corpus graphs, usually counting the number of common edges (i.e., MCES). In some applications, it is also desirable that the common subgraph be connected, i.e., the maximum common connected subgraph (MCCS). Finding exact MCES and MCCS is intractable, but may be unnecessary if ranking corpus graphs by relevance is the goal. We design fast and trainable neural functions that approximate MCES and MCCS well. Late interaction methods compute dense representations for the query and corpus graph separately, and compare these representations using simple similarity functions at the last stage, leading to highly scalable systems. Early interaction methods combine information from both graphs right from the input stages, are usually considerably more accurate, but slower. We propose both late and early interaction neural MCES and MCCS formulations. They are both based on a continuous relaxation of a node alignment matrix between query and corpus nodes. For MCCS, we propose a novel differentiable network for estimating the size of the largest connected common subgraph. Extensive experiments with seven data sets show that our proposals are superior among late interaction models in terms of both accuracy and speed. Our early interaction models provide accuracy competitive with the state of the art, at substantially greater speeds.},

  abstract = {We introduce ART, a new corpus-level autoencoding approach for training dense retrieval models that does not require any labeled training data. Dense retrieval is a central challenge for open-domain tasks, such as Open QA, where state-of-the-art methods typically require large supervised datasets with custom hard-negative mining and denoising of positive examples. ART, in contrast, only requires access to unpaired inputs and outputs (e.g., questions and potential answer passages). It uses a new passage-retrieval autoencoding scheme, where (1) an input question is used to retrieve a set of evidence passages, and (2) the passages are then used to compute the probability of reconstructing the original question. Training for retrieval based on question reconstruction enables effective unsupervised learning of both passage and question encoders, which can be later incorporated into complete Open QA systems without any further finetuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ART obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple QA retrieval benchmarks with only generic initialization from a pre-trained language model, removing the need for labeled data and task-specific losses.1Our code and model checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/DevSinghSachan/art.},

  abstract = {A hallmark property of explainable AI models is the ability to teach other agents, communicating knowledge of how to perform a task. While Large Language Models perform complex reasoning by generating explanations for their predictions, it is unclear whether they also make good teachers for weaker agents. To address this, we consider a student-teacher framework between two LLM agents and study if, when, and how the teacher should intervene with natural language explanations to improve the student's performance. Since communication is expensive, we define a budget such that the teacher only communicates explanations for a fraction of the data, after which the student should perform well on its own. We decompose the teaching problem along four axes: (1) if teacher's test time intervention improve student predictions, (2) when it is worth explaining a data point, (3) how the teacher should personalize explanations to better teach the student, and (4) if teacher explanations also improve students on future unexplained data. We first show that teacher LLMs can indeed intervene on student reasoning to improve their performance. Next, inspired by the Theory of Mind abilities of effective teachers, we propose building two few-shot mental models of the student. The first model defines an Intervention Function that simulates the utility of an intervention, allowing the teacher to intervene when this utility is the highest and improving student performance at lower budgets. The second model enables the teacher to personalize explanations for a particular student and outperform unpersonalized teachers. We also demonstrate that in multi-turn interactions, teacher explanations generalize and learning from explained data improves student performance on future unexplained data. Finally, we verify that misaligned teachers can lower student performance to random chance by intentionally misleading them.},

Secondly, we analyze the performance of RDBMS, RDF and Triple Stores for the knowledge representation.

The results show, that natural language access to industry data using ontologies and lexicons, is a simple but effective approach to improve the diagnosis process and the data search for a broad range of users. Furthermore, virtual RDF graphs do support the DB-driven knowledge graph representation process, but do not perform efficient under industry conditions in terms of performance and scalability.},

Practitioners therefore employ domain adaptation from resource-rich domains that are, in most cases, distant from the target domain. Domain adaptation between distant domains (e.g., movie subtitles and research papers), however, cannot be performed effectively due to mismatches in vocabulary; it will encounter many domain-specific words (e.g., ``angstrom'') and words whose meanings shift across domains (e.g., ``conductor''). In this study, aiming to solve these vocabulary mismatches in domain adaptation for neural machine translation (NMT), we propose vocabulary adaptation, a simple method for effective fine-tuning that adapts embedding layers in a given pretrained NMT model to the target domain. Prior to fine-tuning, our method replaces the embedding layers of the NMT model by projecting general word embeddings induced from monolingual data in a target domain onto a source-domain embedding space. Experimental results indicate that our method improves the performance of conventional fine-tuning by 3.86 and 3.28 BLEU points in En-Ja and De-En translation, respectively.},

Yet, the ever-increasing size of RDF data collections makes it more and more infeasible to store and process them on a single machine, raising the need for distributed approaches. Instead of building a standalone but closed distributed RDF store, we endorse the usage of existing infrastructures for Big Data processing, e.g. Hadoop. However, SPARQL query performance is a major challenge as these platforms are not designed for RDF processing from ground. Thus, existing Hadoop-based approaches often favor certain query pattern shape while performance drops significantly for other shapes. In this paper, we describe a novel relational partitioning schema for RDF data called ExtVP that uses a semi-join based preprocessing, akin to the concept of Join Indices in relational databases, to efficiently minimize query input size regardless of its pattern shape and diameter. Our prototype system S2RDF is built on top of Spark and uses its relational interface to execute SPARQL queries over ExtVP. We demonstrate its superior performance in comparison to state of the art SPARQL-on-Hadoop approaches using the recent WatDiv test suite. S2RDF achieves sub-second runtimes for majority of queries on a billion triples RDF graph.},

The phrase was first used in the 1970s by Yorick Wilks as the basis for machine translation programs working with only semantic representations. Semantic parsing is one of the important tasks in computational linguistics and natural language processing. Semantic parsing maps text to formal meaning representations. This contrasts with semantic role labeling and other forms of shallow semantic processing, which do not aim to produce complete formal meanings. In computer vision, semantic parsing is a process of segmentation for 3D objects.},

In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented knowledge graph (RAKG) model, which solves the above issues using two key innovations. First, we leverage the density matrix to make the model reason along the corrected knowledge path and extract an enhanced subgraph of the knowledge graph. Second, we fuse representations of questions and graph entities through a bidirectional attention strategy, in which two representations fuse and update using a graph convolutional network (GCN). To evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets: CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA. The case study gives insight into the finding that the augmented subgraph provides reasoning along the corrected knowledge path for question answering.},

Especially novice users need to acquire both knowledge about the underlying ontology structure and proficiency in formulating formal queries (e.g. SPARQL queries) to retrieve information from Linked Data sources. So as to simplify and automate the querying and retrieval of information from such sources, this paper presents an approach for constructing SPARQL queries based on user-supplied keywords. Our approach utilizes a set of predefined basic graph pattern templates for generating adequate interpretations of user queries. This is achieved by obtaining ranked lists of candidate resource identifiers for the supplied keywords and then injecting these identifiers into suitable positions in the graph pattern templates. The main advantages of our approach are that it is completely agnostic of the underlying knowledge base and ontology schema, that it scales to large knowledge bases and is simple to use. We evaluate all 17 possible valid graph pattern templates by measuring their precision and recall on 53 queries against DBpedia. Our results show that 8 of these basic graph pattern templates return results with a precision above 70\%. Our approach is implemented as a Web search interface and performs sufficiently fast to provide answers within an acceptable time frame even when used on large knowledge bases.},

  abstract = {The problem of natural language processing over structured data has become a growing research field, both within the relational database and the Semantic Web community, with significant efforts involved in question answering over knowledge graphs (KGQA). However, many of these approaches are either specifically targeted at open-domain question answering using DBpedia, or require large training datasets to translate a natural language question to SPARQL in order to query the knowledge graph. Hence, these approaches often cannot be applied directly to complex scientific datasets where no prior training data is available. In this paper, we focus on the challenges of natural language processing over knowledge graphs of scientific datasets. In particular, we introduce Bio-SODA, a natural language processing engine that does not require training data in the form of question-answer pairs for generating SPARQL queries. Bio-SODA uses a generic graph-based approach for translating user questions to a ranked list of SPARQL candidate queries. Furthermore, Bio-SODA uses a novel ranking algorithm that includes node centrality as a measure of relevance for selecting the best SPARQL candidate query. Our experiments with real-world datasets across several scientific domains, including the official bioinformatics Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD) challenge, as well as the CORDIS dataset of European projects, show that Bio-SODA outperforms publicly available KGQA systems by an F1-score of least 20\% and by an even higher factor on more complex bioinformatics datasets. Finally, we introduce Bio-SODA UX, a graphical user interface designed to assist users in the exploration of large knowledge graphs and in dynamically disambiguating natural language questions that target the data available in these graphs.},

  abstract = {The conceptual design of the Extract -- Transform -- Load (ETL) processes is a crucial, burdensome, and challenging procedure that takes places at the early phases of a Data Warehouse project. Several models have been proposed for the conceptual design and representation of ETL processes, but all share two inconveniences: they require intensive human effort from the designers to create them, as well as technical knowledge from the business people to understand them. In a previous work, we have relaxed the former difficulty by working on the automation of the conceptual design leveraging Semantic Web technology. In this paper, we built upon our previous results and we tackle the second issue by investigating the application of natural language generation techniques to the ETL environment. In particular, we provide a method for the representation of a conceptual ETL design as a narrative, which is the most natural means of communication and does not require knowledge of any specific model. We discuss how linguistic techniques can be used for the establishment of a common application vocabulary. Finally, we present a flexible and customizable template-based mechanism for generating natural language representations for the ETL process requirements and operations.},

  abstract = {For over 50 years researchers and practitioners have searched for ways to elicit and formalize expert knowledge to support AI applications. Expert systems and knowledge bases were all results of these efforts. The initial efforts on knowledge bases were focused on defining a domain and task intensionally with rather complex ontologies. The increasing complexity of knowledge and knowledge-based systems eventually led to the development of knowledge engineering methodologies. Knowledge graphs, in contrast to the traditional knowledge bases, represent knowledge more extensionally with a very large set of explicit statements and rather simpler and smaller ontologies. This paradigm change calls for a new take on knowledge engineering that focuses on the curation of ABox statements. In this paper, we introduce various aspects of the knowledge graphs lifecycle namely creation, hosting, curation and deployment. We define each task, give example approaches from the literature and explain our approach with a running example. Additionally, we present the German Tourism Knowledge Graph that is being implemented with our methodology.},

RAG has only been trained and explored with a Wikipedia-based external knowledge base and is not optimized for use in other specialized domains such as healthcare and news. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of joint training of the retriever and generator components of RAG for the task of domain adaptation in ODQA. We propose RAG-end2end, an extension to RAG that can adapt to a domain-specific knowledge base by updating all components of the external knowledge base during training. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary training signal to inject more domain-specific knowledge. This auxiliary signal forces RAG-end2end to reconstruct a given sentence by accessing the relevant information from the external knowledge base. Our novel contribution is that, unlike RAG, RAG-end2end does joint training of the retriever and generator for the end QA task and domain adaptation. We evaluate our approach with datasets from three domains: COVID-19, News, and Conversations, and achieve significant performance improvements compared to the original RAG model. Our work has been open-sourced through the HuggingFace Transformers library, attesting to our work's credibility and technical consistency.},

  abstract = {The need for transparency of predictive systems based on Machine Learning algorithms arises as a consequence of their ever-increasing proliferation in the industry. Whenever black-box algorithmic predictions influence human affairs, the inner workings of these algorithms should be scrutinised and their decisions explained to the relevant stakeholders, including the system engineers, the system's operators and the individuals whose case is being decided. While a variety of interpretability and explainability methods is available, none of them is a panacea that can satisfy all diverse expectations and competing objectives that might be required by the parties involved. We address this challenge in this paper by discussing the promises of Interactive Machine Learning for improved transparency of black-box systems using the example of contrastive explanations---a state-of-the-art approach to Interpretable Machine Learning. Specifically, we show how to personalise counterfactual explanations by interactively adjusting their conditional statements and extract additional explanations by asking follow-up ``What if?'' questions. Our experience in building, deploying and presenting this type of system allowed us to list desired properties as well as potential limitations, which can be used to guide the development of interactive explainers. While customising the medium of interaction, i.e., the user interface comprising of various communication channels, may give an impression of personalisation, we argue that adjusting the explanation itself and its content is more important. To this end, properties such as breadth, scope, context, purpose and target of the explanation have to be considered, in addition to explicitly informing the explainee about its limitations and caveats. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges of mirroring the explainee's mental model, which is the main building block of intelligible human--machine interactions. We also deliberate on the risks of allowing the explainee to freely manipulate the explanations and thereby extracting information about the underlying predictive model, which might be leveraged by malicious actors to steal or game the model. Finally, building an end-to-end interactive explainability system is a challenging engineering task; unless the main goal is its deployment, we recommend ``Wizard of Oz'' studies as a proxy for testing and evaluating standalone interactive explainability algorithms.},

A popular application is to quantify semantic similarity between high-dimensional objects by applying cosine-similarity to a learned low-dimensional feature embedding. This can work better but sometimes also worse than the unnormalized dot-product between embedded vectors in practice. To gain insight into this empirical observation, we study embeddings derived from regularized linear models, where closed-form solutions facilitate analytical insights. We derive analytically how cosine-similarity can yield arbitrary and therefore meaningless `similarities.' For some linear models the similarities are not even unique, while for others they are implicitly controlled by the regularization. We discuss implications beyond linear models: a combination of different regularizations are employed when learning deep models; these have implicit and unintended effects when taking cosine-similarities of the resulting embeddings, rendering results opaque and possibly arbitrary. Based on these insights, we caution against blindly using cosine-similarity and outline alternatives.},

We formulate cross-domain semantic parsing as a domain adaptation problem: train a semantic parser on some source domains and then adapt it to the target domain. Due to the diversity of logical forms in different domains, this problem presents unique and intriguing challenges. By converting logical forms into canonical utterances in natural language, we reduce semantic parsing to paraphrasing, and develop an attentive sequence-to-sequence paraphrase model that is general and flexible to adapt to different domains. We discover two problems, small micro variance and large macro variance, of pre-trained word embeddings that hinder their direct use in neural networks, and propose standardization techniques as a remedy. On the popular Overnight dataset, which contains eight domains, we show that both cross-domain training and standardized pre-trained word embeddings can bring significant improvement.},

Building on recent advances in graph representation learning we propose a novel model, GRAFT-Net, for extracting answers from a question-specific subgraph containing text and KB entities and relations. We construct a suite of benchmark tasks for this problem, varying the difficulty of questions, the amount of training data, and KB completeness. We show that GRAFT-Net is competitive with the state-of-the-art when tested using either KBs or text alone, and vastly outperforms existing methods in the combined setting.},

  abstract = {Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design, integrate, and manage complex systems over their life cycles. At its core, systems engineering utilizes systems thinking principles to organize this body of knowledge. The individual outcome of such efforts, an engineered system, can be defined as a combination of components that work in synergy to collectively perform a useful function. Issues such as requirements engineering, reliability, logistics, coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability, and many other disciplines, aka "ilities",  necessary for successful system design, development, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work processes, optimization methods, and risk management tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as industrial engineering, production systems engineering, process systems engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, production engineering, control engineering, software engineering, electrical engineering, cybernetics, aerospace engineering, organizational studies, civil engineering and project management. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered and integrated into a whole. The systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high-quality outputs with minimum cost and time. The systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved and identifying the most probable or highest-impact failures that can occur. Systems engineering involves finding solutions to these problems.},

  abstract = {Many ontologies, i.e., Description Logic (DL) knowledge bases, have been developed to provide rich knowledge about various domains. An ontology consists of an ABox, i.e., assertion axioms between two entities or between a concept and an entity, and a TBox, i.e., terminology axioms between two concepts. Neural logical reasoning (NLR) is a fundamental task to explore such knowledge bases, which aims at answering multi-hop queries with logical operations based on distributed representations of queries and answers. While previous NLR methods can give specific entity-level answers, i.e., ABox answers, they are not able to provide descriptive concept-level answers, i.e., TBox answers, where each concept is a description of a set of entities. In other words, previous NLR methods only reason over the ABox of an ontology while ignoring the TBox. In particular, providing TBox answers enables inferring the explanations of each query with descriptive concepts, which make answers comprehensible to users and are of great usefulness in the field of applied ontology. In this work, we formulate the problem of neural logical reasoning across TBox and ABox (TA-NLR), solving which needs to address challenges in incorporating, representing, and operating on concepts. We propose an original solution named TAR for TA-NLR. Firstly, we incorporate description logic based ontological axioms to provide the source of concepts. Then, we represent concepts and queries as fuzzy sets, i.e., sets whose elements have degrees of membership, to bridge concepts and queries with entities. Moreover, we design operators involving concepts on top of fuzzy set representation of concepts and queries for optimization and inference. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TAR for TA-NLR.},

In this work, we propose Graph Neural Prompting (GNP), a novel plug-and-play method to assist pre-trained LLMs in learning beneficial knowledge from KGs. GNP encompasses various designs, including a standard graph neural network encoder, a crossmodality pooling module, a domain projector, and a selfsupervised link prediction objective.

  abstract = {Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) promotes increased consistency between a system's design and its design documentation through the use of an object-oriented system model. The creation of this system model facilitates data presentation by providing a mechanism from which information can be extracted by automated manipulation of model content. Existing MBSE tools enable model creation, but are often too complex for the unfamiliar model viewer to easily use. These tools do not yet provide many opportunities for easing into the development and use of a system model when system design documentation already exists. This study creates a Systems Modeling Language (SysML) Document Traceability Framework (SDTF) for integrating design documentation with a system model, and develops an Interactive Visualization Engine for SysML Tools (InVEST), that exports consistent, clear, and concise views of SysML model data. These exported views are each meaningful to a variety of project stakeholders with differing subjects of concern and depth of technical involvement. InVEST allows a model user to generate multiple views and reports from a MBSE model, including wiki pages and interactive visualizations of data. System data can also be filtered to present only the information relevant to the particular stakeholder, resulting in a view that is both consistent with the larger system model and other model views. Viewing the relationships between system artifacts and documentation, and filtering through data to see specialized views improves the value of the system as a whole, as data becomes information.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Learning powerful data embeddings has become a center piece in machine learning, especially in natural language processing and computer vision domains. The crux of these embeddings is that they are pretrained on huge corpus of data in a unsupervised fashion, sometimes aided with transfer learning. However currently in the graph learning domain, embeddings learned through existing graph neural networks (GNNs) are task dependent and thus cannot be shared across different datasets. In this paper, we present a first powerful and theoretically guaranteed graph neural network that is designed to learn task-independent graph embeddings, thereafter referred to as deep universal graph embedding (DUGNN). Our DUGNN model incorporates a novel graph neural network (as a universal graph encoder) and leverages rich Graph Kernels (as a multi-task graph decoder) for both unsupervised learning and (task-specific) adaptive supervised learning. By learning task-independent graph embeddings across diverse datasets, DUGNN also reaps the benefits of transfer learning. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that the proposed DUGNN model consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-art GNN models and Graph Kernels by an increased accuracy of 3\% - 8\% on graph classification benchmark datasets.},

It is also possible to extract meaning from the features using a convolution operation in Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Imagine a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that represents research papers. Each paper cites a few other papers in the network. The papers are represented by nodes and citations by edges. The individual papers may be based on a few different topics: say Machine Learning, NLP, GenAI, Computer Vision etc. Often when we are referring to a paper, we are very interested to find similar papers. Is it possible to group the papers into a few different categories using the framework of GNN? This is totally possible. To classify the papers (nodes of the GNN), we consider the features of the papers (nodes) as well as those of the neighboring nodes (features of cited papers). We can accomplish feature aggregation and node classification using a concept called Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). This lecture teaches you how to use GCN to perform a simple node classification operation, using a numerical example. The example is very easy to understand. If you are a total beginner or have no idea about GNNs I am quite certain that this lecture will still help you. I build the GNN from scratch and hand-calculate the message passing, feature aggregation, transformation and node classification. Very simple. Please check out the lecture here.

Learning basic graph patterns is efficient due to the small number of possible patterns. This novel paradigm reduces the amount of training data necessary to achieve state-of-the-art performance. TeBaQA also speeds up the domain adaption process by transforming the QA system development task into a much smaller and easier data compilation task. In our evaluation, TeBaQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on QALD-8 and delivers comparable results on QALD-9 and LC-QuAD v1.

We then use crowdsourcing to paraphrase these canonical utterances into natural utterances. The resulting data is used to train the semantic parser.

However, do DS and ML workers really want to automate their DS/ML workflow? To answer this question, we first synthesize a human-centered AutoML framework with 6 User Role/Personas, 10 Stages and 43 Sub-Tasks, 5 Levels of Automation, and 5 Types of Explanation, through reviewing research literature and marketing reports. Secondly, we use the framework to guide the design of an online survey study with 217 DS/ML workers who had varying degrees of experience, and different user roles "matching" to our 6 roles/personas. We found that different user personas participated in distinct stages of the lifecycle -- but not all stages. Their desired levels of automation and types of explanation for AutoML also varied significantly depending on the DS/ML stage and the user persona. Based on the survey results, we argue there is no rationale from user needs for complete automation of the end-to-end DS/ML lifecycle. We propose new next steps for user-controlled DS/ML automation.},

However, few existing works excel in solving the overlapping triple problem where multiple relational triples in the same sentence share the same entities. In this work, we introduce a fresh perspective to revisit the relational triple extraction task and propose a novel cascade binary tagging framework (CasRel) derived from a principled problem formulation. Instead of treating relations as discrete labels as in previous works, our new framework models relations as functions that map subjects to objects in a sentence, which naturally handles the overlapping problem. Experiments show that the CasRel framework already outperforms state-of-the-art methods even when its encoder module uses a randomly initialized BERT encoder, showing the power of the new tagging framework. It enjoys further performance boost when employing a pre-trained BERT encoder, outperforming the strongest baseline by 17.5 and 30.2 absolute gain in F1-score on two public datasets NYT and WebNLG, respectively. In-depth analysis on different scenarios of overlapping triples shows that the method delivers consistent performance gain across all these scenarios. The source code and data are released online.},

In reality, the real-world graph data typically show dynamics over time, with changing node attributes and edge structure, leading to the severe graph data distribution shift issue. This issue is compounded by the diverse and complex nature of distribution shifts, which can significantly impact the performance of graph learning methods in degraded generalization and adaptation capabilities, posing a substantial challenge to their effectiveness. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review and summary of the latest approaches, strategies, and insights that address distribution shifts within the context of graph learning. Concretely, according to the observability of distributions in the inference stage and the availability of sufficient supervision information in the training stage, we categorize existing graph learning methods into several essential scenarios, including graph domain adaptation learning, graph out-of-distribution learning, and graph continual learning. For each scenario, a detailed taxonomy is proposed, with specific descriptions and discussions of existing progress made in distribution-shifted graph learning. Additionally, we discuss the potential applications and future directions for graph learning under distribution shifts with a systematic analysis of the current state in this field. The survey is positioned to provide general guidance for the development of effective graph learning algorithms in handling graph distribution shifts, and to stimulate future research and advancements in this area.},

Traditional subgraph querying based on subgraph isomorphism requires identical label matching, which is often too restrictive to capture the matches that are semantically close to the query graphs. This paper extends subgraph querying to identify semantically related matches by leveraging ontology information. (1) We introduce the ontology-based subgraph querying, which revises subgraph isomorphism by mapping a query to semantically related subgraphs in terms of a given ontology graph. We introduce a metric to measure the similarity of the matches. Based on the metric, we introduce an optimization problem to find top K best matches. (2) We provide a filtering-and-verification framework to identify (top-K) matches for ontology-based subgraph queries. The framework efficiently extracts a small subgraph of the data graph from an ontology index, and further computes the matches by only accessing the extracted subgraph. (3) In addition, we show that the ontology index can be efficiently updated upon the changes to the data graphs, enabling the framework to cope with dynamic data graphs. (4) We experimentally verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework using both synthetic and real life graphs, comparing with traditional subgraph querying methods.},

  abstract = {Querying complex graph databases such as knowledge graphs is a challenging task for non-professional users. Due to their complex schemas and variational information descriptions, it becomes very hard for users to formulate a query that can be properly processed by the existing systems. We argue that for a user-friendly graph query engine, it must support various kinds of transformations such as synonym, abbreviation, and ontology. Furthermore, the derived query results must be ranked in a principled manner.                            In this paper, we introduce a novel framework enabling {$<$}u{$>$}s{$<$}/u{$>$}chema{$<$}u{$>$}l{$<$}/u{$>$}ess and {$<$}u{$>$}s{$<$}/u{$>$}tructure{$<$}u{$>$}l{$<$}/u{$>$}ess graph {$<$}u{$>$}q{$<$}/u{$>$}uerying (SLQ), where a user need not describe queries precisely as required by most databases. The query engine is built on a set of transformation functions that automatically map keywords and linkages from a query to their matches in a graph. It automatically               learns               an effective ranking model,               without               assuming manually labeled training examples, and can efficiently return top ranked matches using graph sketch and belief propagation. The architecture of SLQ is elastic for "plug-in" new transformation functions and query logs. Our experimental results show that this new graph querying paradigm is promising: It identifies high-quality matches for both keyword and graph queries over real-life knowledge graphs, and outperforms existing methods significantly in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

In this work, we propose a new model, QA-GNN, which addresses the above challenges through two key innovations: (i) relevance scoring, where we use LMs to estimate the importance of KG nodes relative to the given QA context, and (ii) joint reasoning, where we connect the QA context and KG to form a joint graph, and mutually update their representations through graph neural networks. We evaluate our model on QA benchmarks in the commonsense (CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA) and biomedical (MedQA-USMLE) domains. QA-GNN outperforms existing LM and LM+KG models, and exhibits capabilities to perform interpretable and structured reasoning, e.g., correctly handling negation in questions.},

Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer. The code and models of Graphormer will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Microsoft/Graphormer.},

Using it requires a certain familiarity with the entities in the domain to be queried as well as expertise in the language's syntax and semantics, none of which average human web users can be assumed to possess. To overcome this limitation, automatically translating natural language questions to SPARQL queries has been a vibrant field of research. However, to this date, the vast success of deep learning methods has not yet been fully propagated to this research problem. This paper contributes to filling this gap by evaluating the utilization of eight different Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for the task of translating from natural language to the structured query language SPARQL. While highlighting the importance of high-quantity and high-quality datasets, the results show a dominance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture with a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of up to 98 and accuracy of up to 94\%.},

Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach.

The desired subgraph is crucial as a small one may exclude the answer but a large one might introduce more noises. However, the existing retrieval is either heuristic or interwoven with the reasoning, causing reasoning on the partial subgraphs, which increases the reasoning bias when the intermediate supervision is missing. This paper proposes a trainable subgraph retriever (SR) decoupled from the subsequent reasoning process, which enables a plug-and-play framework to enhance any subgraph-oriented KBQA model. Extensive experiments demonstrate SR achieves significantly better retrieval and QA performance than existing retrieval methods. Via weakly supervised pre-training as well as the end-to-end fine-tuning, SR achieves new state-of-the-art performance when combined with NSM (He et al., 2021), a subgraph-oriented reasoner, for embedding-based KBQA methods.

Despite its notable successes, AIGC still faces hurdles such as updating knowledge, handling long-tail data, mitigating data leakage, and managing high training and inference costs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a paradigm to address such challenges. In particular, RAG introduces the information retrieval process, which enhances the generation process by retrieving relevant objects from available data stores, leading to higher accuracy and better robustness. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing efforts that integrate RAG technique into AIGC scenarios. We first classify RAG foundations according to how the retriever augments the generator, distilling the fundamental abstractions of the augmentation methodologies for various retrievers and generators. This unified perspective encompasses all RAG scenarios, illuminating advancements and pivotal technologies that help with potential future progress. We also summarize additional enhancements methods for RAG, facilitating effective engineering and implementation of RAG systems. Then from another view, we survey on practical applications of RAG across different modalities and tasks, offering valuable references for researchers and practitioners. Furthermore, we introduce the benchmarks for RAG, discuss the limitations of current RAG systems, and suggest potential directions for future research.

However, due to the schema-free nature of RDF data, it is very difficult for users to have full knowledge of the underlying schema. Furthermore, the same kind of information can be represented in diverse graph fragments. Hence, it is a huge challenge to formulate complex SPARQL expressions by taking the union of all possible structures.In this paper, we propose an effective framework to access the RDF repository even if users have no full knowledge of the underlying schema. Specifically, given a SPARQL query, the system could return as more answers that match the query based on the semantic similarity as possible. Interestingly, we propose a systematic method to mine diverse semantically equivalent structure patterns. More importantly, incorporating both structural and semantic similarities we are the first to propose a novel similarity measure, semantic graph edit distance. In order to improve the efficiency performance, we apply the semantic summary graph to summarize the knowledge graph, which supports both high-level pruning and drill-down pruning. We also devise an effective lower bound based on the TA-style access to each of the candidate sets. Extensive experiments over real datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning research studies, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas.

The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different data sets, that is, Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31, and the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.},

  abstract = {The increasing size of RDF data requires efficient systems to store and query them. There have been efforts to map RDF data to a relational representation, and a number of systems exist that follow this approach. We have been investigating an alternative approach of maintaining the native graph model to represent RDF data, and utilizing graph database techniques (such as a structure-aware index and a graph matching algorithm) to address RDF data management. Since 2009, we have been developing a set of graph-based RDF data management systems that follow this approach: gStore, gStore-D and gAnswer. The first two are designed to support efficient SPARQL query evaluation in a centralized and distributed/parallel environments, respectively, while the last one aims to provide an easy-to-use interface (natural language question/answering) for users to access a RDF repository. In this paper, we give an overview of these systems and also discuss our design philosophy.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing use of RDF data, efficient processing of SPARQL queries over RDF datasets has become an important issue. However, existing solutions suffer from two limitations: 1) they cannot answer SPARQL queries with wildcards in a scalable manner; and 2) they cannot handle frequent updates in RDF repositories efficiently. Thus, most of them have to reprocess the dataset from scratch. In this paper, we propose a graph-based approach to store and query RDF data. Rather than mapping RDF triples into a relational database as most existing methods do, we store RDF data as a large graph. A SPARQL query is then converted into a corresponding subgraph matching query. In order to speed up query processing, we develop a novel index, together with some effective pruning rules and efficient search algorithms. Our method can answer exact SPARQL queries and queries with wildcards in a uniform manner. We also propose an effective maintenance algorithm to handle online updates over RDF repositories. Extensive experiments confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution.},
